# USDT is not supported because of approval mechanism

## Summary
USDT will revert if the current allowance is greater than 0 and a non-zero approval is made. There are multiple instances throughout the contracts where this causes issues. In some places, this can create scenarios where it becomes impossible to liquidate and/or borrow it.
## Vulnerability Detail
Some tokens do not implement the ERC20 standard properly but are still accepted by most code that accepts ERC20 tokens. For example, Tether (USDT)'s approve() function will revert if the current approval is not zero, to protect against front-running changes of `approvals()`.
## Impact
Only the first listing will start with the conduit's approval at zero and will be able to change it to the maximum. Thereafter, every attempt to approve that same token will revert, causing any order using this lister to revert, including a re-listing at a lower price, which the protocol allows for.

## Recommendation
Set the allowance to 0 before setting it to the new value.
