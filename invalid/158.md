# Possible mismatch between withdrawRequests.length and _acceptedRequestIds.length

## Summary

A weak connection between `withdrawRequests` and `_acceptedRequestIds` could lead to the inability of accepting withdrawal requests.

## Vulnerability Detail

Inside the `SolverVaults::acceptWithdrawRequest()` function, a scenario where `withdrawRequests.length < _acceptedRequestIds.length` would cause this function to revert with an Index out of bounds error.

## Impact

This could lead to the inability of accepting withdrawal requests.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add to the `SolverVaults::acceptWithdrawRequest()` function a check to ensure that `_acceptedRequestIds.length` is at most egal `withdrawRequests.length` .
