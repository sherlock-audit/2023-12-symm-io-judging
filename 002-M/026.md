# Contract cannot operate with collateral tokens which do not return `bool` on `approve` method

## Summary
Contract cannot operate with collateral tokens which do not return `bool` on `approve` method 

## Vulnerability Detail
Some ERC20 tokens such as USDT do not return a `bool` on their `approve` method. The used `IERC20` interface requires a bool value to be returned. Since tokens such as USDT do not return such value, this will cause the transaction to revert 
```solidity
        require(
            IERC20(collateralTokenAddress).approve(address(symmio), amount),
            "SolverVault: Approve failed"
        );
```


## Impact
Contract cannot use tokens such as USDT for collateral
