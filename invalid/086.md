# Functions receiving funds will revert because the contract is not payable

## Summary
Functions receiving funds will revert because the contract is not payable

## Vulnerability Detail
The deposit allows a user to deposit funds into the SolverVaults. However, the function is not marked with "payable" to allow the function receive funds. 

Similar issue is found in acceptWithdrawRequest function. None of the function is marked "payable".

And looking at the whole SolverVault contract, the contract doesn't have a payable receive function. 

## Impact
A user cannot send funds to the contract.

## Code Snippet
   function deposit(uint256 amount) external whenNotPaused {

   function acceptWithdrawRequest(
        uint256 providedAmount,
        uint256[] memory _acceptedRequestIds,
        uint256 _paybackRatio
    ) external onlyRole(BALANCER_ROLE) whenNotPaused {
