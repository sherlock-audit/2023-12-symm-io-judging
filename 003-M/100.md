# Protocol doesn't approve collateral token to zero first before depositing to Symmio

## Summary
Allowance was not set to zero before changing the allowance in `depositToSymmio()`.

## Vulnerability Detail
Some ERC20 tokens (like USDT) do not work when changing the allowance from an existing non-zero allowance value. For example, Tether (USDT)'s `approve()` function will revert if the current approval is not zero, to protect against front-running changes of approvals.

The following attempt to call the `approve()` function without setting the allowance to zero first.

```solidity
File: SolverVaults.sol 
183    function depositToSymmio(uint256 amount) external onlyRole(DEPOSITOR_ROLE) whenNotPaused {
              ...
193        require(
194            IERC20(collateralTokenAddress).approve(address(symmio), amount),
195            "SolverVault: Approve failed"
196        );
              ...
```

## Impact
`depositToSymmio()` will revert after the first deposit as the allowance now is > 0.

## Recommendation

It is recommended to set the allowance to zero before increasing the allowance and use safeApprove/safeIncreaseAllowance.
