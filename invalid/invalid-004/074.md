# SolverVault::acceptWithdrawRequest Shared _paybackRatio Can Lead to Unfair Penalties for Users

## Summary

``acceptWithdrawRequest`` function accepts a single ``_paybackRatio`` which is then applied to all the withdrawal requests in the ``_acceptedRequestIds`` array. This design does not account for the possibility of different withdrawal requests requiring different payback ratios.

## Vulnerability Detail

if there's a fault with one ID, all the others in the same batch will suffer the same penalty because they all share the same payback ratio. This could lead to unfair penalties for some members and could potentially lead to disputes or loss of trust in the system.

## Impact
The current implementation of the acceptWithdrawRequest function applies the same _paybackRatio to all withdrawal requests within a batch, regardless of individual requirements. This design flaw can result in unfair penalties for certain members and may cause disputes

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

A potential solution to this issue could be to modify the function to accept an array of payback ratios instead of a single value. This way, each withdrawal request can have its own payback ratio.

```js
function acceptWithdrawRequest(
    uint256 providedAmount,
    uint256[] memory _acceptedRequestIds,
    uint256[] memory _paybackRatios
) external onlyRole(BALANCER_ROLE) whenNotPaused {
    require(_acceptedRequestIds.length == _paybackRatios.length, "Mismatched arrays");
    ...
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < _acceptedRequestIds.length; i++) {
        uint256 _paybackRatio = _paybackRatios[i];
        ...
        withdrawRequests[id].acceptedRatio = _paybackRatio;
    }
    ...
}
```
