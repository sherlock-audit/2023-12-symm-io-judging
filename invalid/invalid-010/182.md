# Potential DoS attack

## Summary
An attacker can push enormous withdrawals with amount = 0 to `withdrawRequests`, which may bring a potential DoS attack.
## Vulnerability Detail
The function `requestWithdraw` allows a user to submit a withdraw request with amount=0. So an attacker can spend 1 million dollars for gas to push as many withdrawals of amount = 0 as he can. if the `BALANCER_ROLE` is an off-chain bot and scans the request in order, it also needs to spend at least 1 million dollars for gas in order to process the attacker's withdrawals first. but the BALANCER_ROLE doesn't have 1 million dollars so the funds will be locked.
## Impact
The `BALANCER_ROLE` may fail to handle the legitimate user's request due to the dos attack.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Set a minimum amount of withdrawal.
```solidity
    function requestWithdraw(
        uint256 amount,
        address receiver
    ) external whenNotPaused {
           require(amount >= 10 ** 18);
    //...
    }
```
