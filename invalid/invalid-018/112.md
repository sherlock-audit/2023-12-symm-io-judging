# An innocent user could lose their funds if `receiver` is set to `address(0)`

## Summary
A user needs to call [`requestWithdraw`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-symm-io/blob/60ee22a4c598220821385cfb5eee43f40aafd5f1/solver-vaults/contracts/SolverVaults.sol#L201) if they want to withdraw their funds. They have to provide `amount` of Vault token that they will give for the withdraw and the `address` on which they want the withdraw. 
Upon calling this function, a user have to wait for their request to get accepted by `BALANCER` role through [`acceptWithdrawRequest`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-symm-io/blob/60ee22a4c598220821385cfb5eee43f40aafd5f1/solver-vaults/contracts/SolverVaults.sol#L236) after which they can get their withdraw by calling [`claimForWithdrawRequest`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-symm-io/blob/60ee22a4c598220821385cfb5eee43f40aafd5f1/solver-vaults/contracts/SolverVaults.sol#L282) function.

To summarize, it's a 3 step process 
1. Call  `requestWithdraw` by User
2. Call `acceptWithdrawRequest` by Balancer
3. Call `claimForWithdrawRequest` by User

The problem here is that Vault Tokens are burnt during the `requestWithdraw` function [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-symm-io/blob/60ee22a4c598220821385cfb5eee43f40aafd5f1/solver-vaults/contracts/SolverVaults.sol#L210) . 
So if a user mistakenly supplies 0 address while calling `requestWithdraw` [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-symm-io/blob/60ee22a4c598220821385cfb5eee43f40aafd5f1/solver-vaults/contracts/SolverVaults.sol#L203) , there is not way to change that since the tokens are already being burnt before hand. So, all the funds will be transferred to `address(0)` and there is no way user could change that. 

This is a common thing that we have seen in [news](https://cointelegraph.com/news/nft-investor-accidentally-burns-135k-cryptopunk-trying-to-borrow-money).
## Vulnerability Detail
The `requestWithdraw` function is used for requesting withdraw for provided collateral token by exchanging Vault token that a user got while depositing collateral using `deposit` function.

```solidity 
function requestWithdraw(
        uint256 amount,
        address receiver
    ) external whenNotPaused {
        require(
            SolverVaultToken(solverVaultTokenAddress).balanceOf(msg.sender) >=
                amount,
            "SolverVault: Insufficient token balance"
        );
        SolverVaultToken(solverVaultTokenAddress).burnFrom(msg.sender, amount);

        uint256 amountInCollateralDecimals = collateralTokenDecimals >=
            solverVaultTokenDecimals
            ? amount *
                (10 ** (collateralTokenDecimals - solverVaultTokenDecimals))
            : amount /
                (10 ** (solverVaultTokenDecimals - collateralTokenDecimals));

        currentDeposit -= amountInCollateralDecimals;

        withdrawRequests.push(
            WithdrawRequest({
                receiver: receiver,
                amount: amountInCollateralDecimals,
                status: RequestStatus.Pending,
                acceptedRatio: 0
            })
        );
        emit WithdrawRequestEvent(
            withdrawRequests.length - 1,
            receiver,
            amountInCollateralDecimals
        );
    }
```

First it checks if users has actually the amount of balance that they have passed as an input parameter. If this condition holds, then the amount of Vault tokens are burnt from the user account. 

Then the function calculates that amount of collateral that user want to withdraw in exchange of those burnt Vault tokens. 
Then it change `currentDeposit` variable by substracting the amount followed by pushing value in `withdrawRequests` array by changing the status to Pending 

```solidity 
 struct WithdrawRequest {
        address receiver;
        uint256 amount;
        RequestStatus status;
        uint256 acceptedRatio;
    }

    enum RequestStatus {
        Pending,
        Ready,
        Done
    }
// some code ...

 WithdrawRequest[] public withdrawRequests;

// some more code ...
```
Notice how an input validation was done on the `amount` parameter but there was no validation on the `address` parameter. 
Now the balancer will accept withdraw request of the user followed by user claiming the amount as discussed above. Since both the functions of Step 2 and 3 assumes that the input has been correctly validated, there are no checks present there too.

Consider this -
1. Alice wants to withdraw her collateral. So she called the `requestWithdraw` function specifying the amount but mistakenly specified address(0) as a parameter.
2. Now she waits for the balancer to accept her withdraw request. 
3. As soon as the request is accepted and she calls `claimForWithdrawRequest` specifying the request id. 
4. She expects to get withdraw to the receiving address but in reality, the withdraw amount has been burnt to zero address. 

## Impact
User may not be able to recover the deposited funds. 
Assigning this as Medium  since `Causes a loss of funds but requires certain external conditions or specific states.` is true here.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
There needs to be a sanity check at the start of the function like this:
```solidity
function requestWithdraw(
        uint256 amount,
        address receiver
    ) external whenNotPaused {
        require(
            SolverVaultToken(solverVaultTokenAddress).balanceOf(msg.sender) >=
                amount,
            "SolverVault: Insufficient token balance"
        );
        
       // require(receiver != address(0), "Invalid receiver address");
       
        SolverVaultToken(solverVaultTokenAddress).burnFrom(msg.sender, amount);

    // rest of the code ... 
```
