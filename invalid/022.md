# No need to explicitly initialize variables with default values

## Summary

If a variable is not set/initialized, it is assumed to have the default value (0 for uint, false for bool, address(0) for address...). 

## Vulnerability Detail

If a variable is not set/initialized, it is assumed to have the default value (0 for uint, false for bool, address(0) for address...). 

Explicitly initializing it with its default value is an anti-pattern and wastes gas.

As an example: for (uint256 i = 0; i < _acceptedRequestIds.length; ++i) { should be replaced with for (uint256 i; i < _acceptedRequestIds.length; ++i) {

## Impact

Saves gas and is considered an anti-pattern.

`
SolverVaults.sol:102: lockedBalance = 0; // @audit is set to 0 by default, saves gas not setting manually

SolverVaults.sol:103: currentDeposit = 0; // @audit is set to 0 by default, saves gas not setting manually

SolverVaults.sol:257: for (uint256 i = 0; i < _acceptedRequestIds.length; i++) {

## Recommendation

Remove explicit initializations for default values.
