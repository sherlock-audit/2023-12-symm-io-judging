# Lack of Reentrancy Protection in depositToSymmio

## Summary
Lack of Reentrancy Protection in depositToSymmio
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-symm-io/blob/main/solver-vaults/contracts/SolverVaults.sol#L183

## Vulnerability Detail
In Ethereum smart contracts, reentrancy is a potential vulnerability that arises when an external contract call is made before state changes in a contract. An attacker can exploit this by recursively calling back into the vulnerable contract before the state changes are applied, allowing them to repeatedly execute malicious code. To mitigate reentrancy attacks, the "checks-effects-interactions" pattern is commonly recommended, where external calls are made after state changes.

In the code below:

State Changes Before External Call: The state change (`currentDeposit -= amount;`) occurs before the external call to `symmio.depositFor(solver, depositAmount);`.

Potential Reentrancy Vulnerability: If `symmio.depositFor` or any function in the `symmio` contract makes external calls, there is a potential vulnerability to reentrancy attacks. An attacker could create a malicious contract that repeatedly calls back into `depositToSymmio` before the state changes are completed.

## Code Snippet

    function depositToSymmio(uint256 amount) external onlyRole(DEPOSITOR_ROLE) whenNotPaused {
    uint256 contractBalance = IERC20(collateralTokenAddress).balanceOf(address(this));
    require(contractBalance - lockedBalance >= amount, "SolverVault: Insufficient contract balance");

    // Lack of reentrancy protection starts here
    uint256 depositAmount = amount;
    currentDeposit -= amount;

    // External call to another contract before state changes are completed
    require(IERC20(collateralTokenAddress).approve(address(symmio), depositAmount), "SolverVault: Approve failed");
    symmio.depositFor(solver, depositAmount);

    emit DepositToSymmio(msg.sender, solver, depositAmount);
    }


## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Apply the "checks-effects-interactions" pattern to ensure that external calls are made after state changes.

In the modified code below:
The state changes are completed before making any external calls, reducing the risk of reentrancy attacks.
The depositAmount variable is introduced to ensure that the exact amount intended for deposit is used in the external call.
This modification helps protect the contract from potential reentrancy vulnerabilities and follows best practices for secure smart contract development. 

## Code Snippet

    function depositToSymmio(uint256 amount) external onlyRole(DEPOSITOR_ROLE) whenNotPaused {
    uint256 contractBalance = IERC20(collateralTokenAddress).balanceOf(address(this));
    require(contractBalance - lockedBalance >= amount, "SolverVault: Insufficient contract balance");

    // Use a separate state variable to track the amount to be deposited
    uint256 depositAmount = amount;

    // Update the state
    currentDeposit -= amount;

    // External call after state changes are completed
    require(IERC20(collateralTokenAddress).approve(address(symmio), depositAmount), "SolverVault: Approve failed");
    symmio.depositFor(solver, depositAmount);

    emit DepositToSymmio(msg.sender, solver, depositAmount);
    }
