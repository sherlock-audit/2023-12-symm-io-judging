# User may lose his token due to precision loss

## Summary
A user may lose his token due to precision loss.
## Vulnerability Detail
Suppose the collateralTokenDecimals(e.g. USDC) is 6 and the solverVaultTokenDecimals is 18, if a user requests a withdrawal with the amount `10**12-1`, the amountInCollateralDecimals will be zero after the token decimal conversion and the user lost `10**12-1` token forever.
```solidity
        uint256 amountInCollateralDecimals = collateralTokenDecimals >=
            solverVaultTokenDecimals
            ? amount *
                (10 ** (collateralTokenDecimals - solverVaultTokenDecimals))
            : amount /
                (10 ** (solverVaultTokenDecimals - collateralTokenDecimals));
```
