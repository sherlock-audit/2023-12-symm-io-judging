# Miscalculation of the currentBalance and Rounding errors

## Summary
There is a potential miscalculation of the `currentBalance` and also a rounding error issue in `deposit` and `requestWithdraw` functions  at [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-symm-io/blob/main/solver-vaults/contracts/SolverVaults.sol#L158)

## Vulnerability Detail

When users deposited a token into the vault, hes subjected to either of this calculations : 

```solidity
uint256 amountInSolverVaultTokenDecimals = solverVaultTokenDecimals >= collateralTokenDecimals
            ? amount * (10 ** (solverVaultTokenDecimals - collateralTokenDecimals))
            : amount / (10 ** (collateralTokenDecimals - solverVaultTokenDecimals));
```
depending on the `collateralDecimal` and `solverVaultTokenDecimals`

and also when he request for withdraw :

```solidity
 uint256 amountInCollateralDecimals = collateralTokenDecimals >= solverVaultTokenDecimals
            ? amount * (10 ** (collateralTokenDecimals - solverVaultTokenDecimals))
            : amount / (10 ** (solverVaultTokenDecimals - collateralTokenDecimals));
```

The issues here is there is a potential rounding errors, lets say we have `solverVaultTokenDecimals ` of `18`  `collateralTokenDecimals ` of `6` (of course , since thats whats allowed) and   users want to deposit `100` collateral which is of ` 6 decimals`( 100e6)

he will be subjected to this calculations : ` amount * (10 ** (solverVaultTokenDecimals - collateralTokenDecimals))` since  `solverVaultTokenDecimals ` is > collateralTokenDecimals (`18` and `6`) so thats  : `(10 ** (18 - 6) =  10,00,00,00,00,000` , and 100e6 * 10,00,00,00,00,000 = `100000000000000000000` equivalent to `1000`   `SolverVaultToken` for user.

Now `requestWithdraw`:

same calculations except this time user will be subjected to this calculation `amount / (10 ** (solverVaultTokenDecimals - collateralTokenDecimals));` because `collateralTokenDecimals` (`6`) is < `solverVaultTokenDecimals ` (`12`),
 lets say user wants to withdraw 100(100e6)

that means `100e18  /  1000000000000 ` = `0.0001`


## Impact

1. will request a withdrawal of `0.0001`  which will round to zero and is not what he's intended to 
2. `currentDeposit` will filled so easily because there is no way to reduce the value even if user's withdrawal has been proceed

## Recommendation

` For Rounding Errors`
1. First is to put a require statement that whenever it round to zero, just revert, this is the best mitigation for me, or change the computation

`For currentBalance`

1. Use the `amount` that users is trying to withdraw and was the one used during deposit to ensure flexible calculations of user `in` and user `out` instead of `amountInCollateralDecimals` for the requestWithdraw`
