# `SolverVault :: updateCollateral ` and `SolverVault :: setSymmioVaultTokenAddress `  have a `.decimals()` implementation that can drain funds

## Summary

`.decimals()` implementation is from an interface that is not supported by all ERC20 Tokens , it was added later

## Vulnerability Detail

user balance can be reduced from just them depositing into the Vault or can drain funds

## Impact
 This can cause users to lose their funds and withdraw less funds due to incorrect decimal conversions

## Code Snippet
```javascript
 function updateCollateral() internal {
         collateralTokenAddress = symmio.getCollateral();
         collateralTokenDecimals = IERC20Metadata(collateralTokenAddress)
@>           .decimals();
        require(
            collateralTokenDecimals <= 18,
            "SolverVault: Collateral decimals should be lower than 18"
        );
    }

    function setSymmioVaultTokenAddress(
        address _symmioVaultTokenAddress
    ) internal {
          require(_symmioVaultTokenAddress != address(0), "SolverVault: Zero address");
          solverVaultTokenAddress = _symmioVaultTokenAddress;
          solverVaultTokenDecimals = SolverVaultToken(_symmioVaultTokenAddress)
 @>           .decimals();
           require(
            solverVaultTokenDecimals <= 18,
            "SolverVault: SolverVaultToken decimals should be lower than 18"
        );
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Always check the token contract for its decimals parameter. if a token has 6 decimals, you should multiply or divide by 10^6 to handle the correct values.Using established libraries that provide functions for handling token decimals. Make sure that this protocol can handle all type of ERC20 decimal standardizeds
