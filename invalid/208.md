# Unnecessary transfer of Funds

## Summary
Transferring funds without checking while accepting Withdraw request.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the `acceptWithdrawRequest()`, the contract blindly transfers tokens from the Balancer to itself without checking if there's already enough balance available in the SolverVaults contract. This behavior could lead to unnecessary token transfers and potential issues with fund management.

## Impact
The continuous and unnecessary transfer of funds from the Balancer, regardless of the SolverVaults' balance, could accumulate operational costs over time.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
function acceptWithdrawRequest(
    uint256 providedAmount,
    uint256[] memory _acceptedRequestIds,
    uint256 _paybackRatio
) external onlyRole(BALANCER_ROLE) whenNotPaused {
    require(
        _paybackRatio >= minimumPaybackRatio,
        "SolverVault: Payback ratio is too low"
    );
    
// code ..........

    if (IERC20(collateralTokenAddress).balanceOf(address(this)) < totalRequiredBalance) {
    // Transfer funds from the Balancer only if needed
    IERC20(collateralTokenAddress).safeTransferFrom(
        msg.sender,
        address(this),
        totalRequiredBalance - IERC20(collateralTokenAddress).balanceOf(address(this))
);
    lockedBalance = totalRequiredBalance;
    emit WithdrawRequestAcceptedEvent(
        providedAmount,
        _acceptedRequestIds,
        _paybackRatio
    );
}
