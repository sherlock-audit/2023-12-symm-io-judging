# The protocol may be incompatible with USDT due to Approval Protection.

## Summary
The protocol may be incompatible with USDT due to Approval Protection.

## Vulnerability Detail
USDT does not permit approving a new amount M > 0 when there is already an existing approved amount N > 0. If the `symmio.depositFor` implementation does not transfer all tokens, resulting in a remaining approval amount, the `depositToSymmio` function will fail.

## Impact
The protocol is designed to interact with the USDT token. This token is subject to an approval race condition. Without first setting the approval to 0, the second approval attempt in `depositFor` will revert.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Reset the approval to 0 before providing a new approval.
