# Protocol is incompatible with USDT due to lack of 0 approval

## Summary
Protocol is incompatible with USDT due to lack of 0 approval

## Vulnerability Detail

Per the contest readme, USDT is one of the tokens which will be interacting with contracts.

> Which ERC20 tokens do you expect will interact with the smart contracts?
USDT, USDC

USDT token do not work when changing the allowance from an existing non-zero allowance value. For example Tether (USDT)’s approve() function will revert if the current approval is not zero, to protect against front-running changes of approvals. [Link to usdt contract reference(SLOC 199-209)](https://etherscan.io/address/0xdac17f958d2ee523a2206206994597c13d831ec7#code)

In the protocol, all functions using approve() must be first approved by zero. In `SolverVaults.sol`,  `depositToSymmio()` is called to make ERC20 approvals i.e collateralTokenAddress which is USDC or USDT. But it does not approve 0 first in case of USDT as collateralTokenAddress.

## Impact
Tokens like USDT will not be possible to approve or use in depositToSymmio function

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use `forceApprove()` from already used openZeppelin’s SafeERC20 OR alternatively, approve 0 first.
