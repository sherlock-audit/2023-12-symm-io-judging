# If the `receiver` address is blocked by the `USDT` or `USDC` contracts, the funds will be locked within the `SolverVault` contract.

## Summary

The `USDT` and `USDC` token contracts on some networks can block addresses from using the tokens(Eg: Arbitrum netwok). If the receiver's address is blocked the `USDT` or `USDC` contracts after initiating a withdrawal request but before the withdrawal is processed, the `claimForWithdrawRequest` function will be unsuccessful in transferring the tokens to the intended receiver address.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the `SolverVault` contract, which interacts with `USDT` and `USDC` tokens as collateral token, there is a risk associated with the ability of these tokens on the Arbitrum network to block addresses. The contract lacks a mechanism to use an alternative `receiver` address for withdrawing collateral tokens if the provided `receiver` address is blocked. 

In  `SolverVault` contract, There is no mechanism to use alternative receiver address to withdraw collateral tokens. The collateral tokens are only withdrawal to an address which is the receivers address passed to `requestWithdraw()` as receiver address. Which is not possible to change the address after made the request. So that if the receiver is blocked, the funds remain in the `SolverVault` contract without a clear mechanism to release them to the rightful owner.

When initiating a withdrawal with `claimForWithdrawRequest` function, the collateral tokens can only be sent to the initially specified `receiver` address in the `requestWithdraw` function. Changing the address after making the withdrawal request is not possible. Therefore, if the designated `receiver` address is blocked, the funds will be locked in the `SolverVault` contract without a clear mechanism to release them to the rightful owner.

## Impact

The funds will be trapped within the `SolverVault` contract, as the transfer is rejected by the token contract due to the address being blocked.

## Code Snippet

```solidity

201:    function requestWithdraw(
202:        uint256 amount,
203: @>     address receiver
204:    ) external whenNotPaused {
.
.
.        
221:        withdrawRequests.push(
222:            WithdrawRequest({
223: @>             receiver: receiver,
224:                amount: amountInCollateralDecimals,
225:                status: RequestStatus.Pending,
226:                acceptedRatio: 0
227:            })

Take a look at the `requestWithdraw` function, specifically at line 223 in the provided code. This is where the receiver for fund withdrawal is established, and the address is passed at line number 203.

```solidity

File: solver-vaults/contracts/SolverVaults.sol

282:    function claimForWithdrawRequest(uint256 requestId) external whenNotPaused {
.
.
.
287:    WithdrawRequest storage request = withdrawRequests[requestId];
.
.
.
297: @> IERC20(collateralTokenAddress).safeTransfer(request.receiver, amount);
```

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-symm-io/blob/main/solver-vaults/contracts/SolverVaults.sol#L282C5-L299C6

In the `claimForWithdrawRequest` function, observe line number 297, where the collateral is transferred to the receiver address set by the `requestWithdraw` function.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Update the `claimForWithdrawRequest()` function to accommodate any address and facilitate the transfer of funds to the address specified by the rightful owner.
