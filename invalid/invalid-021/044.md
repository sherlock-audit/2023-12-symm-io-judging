# Vaults can be drained using cross-vault deposits and withdrawals

## Summary

A malicious user can deposit in vaults with a collateral token of lower value and then execute a withdrawal using a vault that uses a collateral token of higher value.

## Vulnerability Detail

When users deposit in the SolverVault contract they are minted SVT tokens (SolverVaultToken). These SVT can then be redeemed to issue a withdrawal request of the previously deposited collateral.

If multiple vaults are deployed using different non-pegged collateral assets, then a malicious user can execute a deposit in a vault that uses a collateral of lower value, get SVT tokens, and then use those to execute a withdrawal in a vault that has a collateral of higher value. 

The attack doesn't necessarily require the presence of vaults that naturally have dissimilar prices (like USDC and WETH). It can also be executed when having vaults using assets that are expected to have a similar price but fluctuate due to market conditions. For example, using USDC and USDT, during the Silicon Valley bank crisis the price of USDC dropped 10-15% while USDT kept its 1 USD peg.

## Impact

Vaults can be drained when having another vault that has a collateral token of different value.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Each vault should deploy its own SolverVaultToken, or directly make the SolverVault contract an ERC20 that gets minted or burned during deposits or withdrawals.
