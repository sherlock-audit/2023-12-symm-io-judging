# User cannot deposit `collateralToken`, beacuse the `collateralTokenAddress` don't have `safeTransferFrom` method

## Summary
User cannot deposit or request withdraw `collateral Token`, beacuse the `collateralTokenAddress` don't have `safeTransferFrom` method .

## Vulnerability Detail
The collateral Token are not implement openzeppelin's ERC20 contract .

I asked Navid the collateral address across different chains .

I mean the implement contract of the interface  ISymmio 
so I can call getCollateral() to get real collateral contract address across different chain

currrently 0x55d398326f99059ff775485246999027b3197955 on BNB and 0x833589fCD6eDb6E08f4c7C32D4f71b54bdA02913 on Base

OK

So I check the contract methods on bsc explorer and base chain explorer .

https://basescan.org/address/0x833589fCD6eDb6E08f4c7C32D4f71b54bdA02913#writeProxyContract

But there is no `safeTransferFrom` in these contracts , so user's collateral token cannot be transfered into `SolverVault` contract even though the user has already approved their token to `SolverVault` contract .

## Impact
Collateral Token cannot be deposited into this Contract , so it is failure to meet `SolverVault ` requirements .

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-symm-io/blob/main/solver-vaults/contracts/SolverVaults.sol#L163-L167
```solidity
 IERC20(collateralTokenAddress).safeTransferFrom(
            msg.sender,
            address(this),
            amount
        );
```

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-symm-io/blob/main/solver-vaults/contracts/SolverVaults.sol#L241-L245

```solidity
  IERC20(collateralTokenAddress).safeTransferFrom(
            msg.sender,
            address(this),
            providedAmount
        );
```
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-symm-io/blob/main/solver-vaults/contracts/SolverVaults.sol#L297

```solidity
 IERC20(collateralTokenAddress).safeTransfer(request.receiver, amount);
```


## Tool used

Manual Review, VSCode, BSCscan, BaseScan

## Recommendation
Change from `safeTransferFrom` to `transferFrom` , thus to statisfy these collateral token's method .

```solidity
 IERC20(collateralTokenAddress).
 - safeTransferFrom(
 + transferFrom(
             msg.sender,
            address(this),
            providedAmount
        );
```
