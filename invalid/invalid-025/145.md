# Blocklisted receiver may lead to locked funds into the vault

## Summary

USDT and USDC have the ability to block addresses, preventing them from sending or receiving funds. Blocked addresses cannot access the funds, leading to a situation where funds in the Solver Vault may become inaccessible.

## Vulnerability Detail

The issue lies in the SolverVaults contract, which lacks the capability to cancel or edit a WithdrawRequest record. If a receiver's address is blocked after a withdraw request is accepted, the user would not be able to claim the funds because transfers to blocklisted addresses are forbidden. Users have no way to modify the receiver's address. As a result, the funds remain locked in the lockedBalance. 
The only way for the contract owners to fix this would be to upgrade the contract and add such a feature. It takes time and would contradicts the promise that users will be able to withdraw their funds at any time.

## Impact

Locked user funds into the contract with no easy way to unlock them.
