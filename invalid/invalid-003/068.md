# A malicious user could DoS the contract by repeatedly calling requestWithdraw function

## Summary
By repeatedly calling `requestWithdraw` function, a malicious user could make the function unusable

## Vulnerability Detail
Upon invocation of the function `requestWithdraw`, the `WithdrawRequests` array is populated with request information. However, this array is never emptied even after claiming withdraw which would potentially enable an attacker to repeatedly request multiple withdrawals using the minimum collateral amount and causing the array to become not fillable.

## Impact

users could encounter considerable loss of funds while not being able to withdraw their funds.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

I recommend to delete the related withdraw request information from `WithdrawRequests` after claiming the funds.
