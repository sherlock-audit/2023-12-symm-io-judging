# Reentrancy may allow to bypass deposit limit

## Summary

A reentrancy type of attack can be used to execute deposits beyond the limit.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `deposit()` function checks that the current deposited amount, `currentDeposit`, plus the given `amount` should not exceed the limit, `depositLimit`.

However, if `collateralTokenAddress` implements hooks (like ERC777), a malicious user could reenter the function during the `safeTransferFrom()` call to perform a second deposit with a stale `currentDeposit`, as this updated later in the function

```solidity
    function deposit(uint256 amount) external whenNotPaused {
        require(
            currentDeposit + amount <= depositLimit,
            "SolverVault: Deposit limit reached"
        );
        IERC20(collateralTokenAddress).safeTransferFrom(
            msg.sender,
            address(this),
            amount
        );
        
        ....
        
        currentDeposit += amount;
        emit Deposit(msg.sender, amount);
    }
```

Steps:

1. Say `currentDeposit = 5` and `depositLimit = 10`.
2. User calls `deposit(5)`, check is valid since `5 + 5 <= 10`.
3. User reenters function during `safeTransferFrom()` and calls `deposit(5)` again. Check is still valid since `currentDeposit` is still 5, so `5 + 5 <= 10`.
4. Both calls are successful and the user deposited beyond the limit.

## Impact

A user could bypass the check using a reentrancy pattern and deposit beyond the protocol limits.

## Recommendation

Perform the update to `currentDeposit` before executing side effects like `safeTransferFrom()`.

```solidity
    function deposit(uint256 amount) external whenNotPaused {
        currentDeposit += amount;
        require(
            currentDeposit <= depositLimit,
            "SolverVault: Deposit limit reached"
        );
        IERC20(collateralTokenAddress).safeTransferFrom(
            msg.sender,
            address(this),
            amount
        );
```
