# Fee on transfer tokens will break the deposit/withdraw process

## Summary
Currently, USDT and USDC do not charge fees. However, they may introduce fees in the future. This potential change could lead to withdrawal issues due to accounting discrepancies.

## Vulnerability Detail
In numerous instances within the code, there is a `transferFrom` function that moves tokens from the user to the protocol. The protocol stores the value based on the amount argument from this function. However, if fee-on-transfer tokens like USDT and USDC start charging fees, it could lead to operational issues. Specifically, the protocol would cache more value than it receives due to the fee deduction. Consequently, when the protocol attempts to `transfer` these tokens later, it may face a shortfall in the balance, leading to failed transactions or stuck tokens.

## Impact
Potential risk of tokens getting stuck in the protocol.

## Recommendation

Consider checking the balance of the contract before and after token transfers and using instead of the amount specified in the contract.
