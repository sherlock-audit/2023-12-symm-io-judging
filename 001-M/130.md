# Incompatible soldity compiler version

## Summary

Project uses solidity compiler version 0.8.20 which is not compatible with certain EVM based blockchains which project wants to deploy on.

## Vulnerability Detail


> Q: On what chains are the smart contracts going to be deployed?

BNB, Arbitrum, Polygon, Base, opBNB, zkEVM, Optimism

On Optimism and Arbitrum, `PUSH0` instruction is not supported in their EVM version, so contract deployment & interactions will fail.

- https://docs.optimism.io/chain/differences

## Impact

Contracts will be rendered unusable on optimism and arbitrum

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Either specify evmVersion as paris or lower in hardhat config, or use compiler version 0.8.19 or below.
