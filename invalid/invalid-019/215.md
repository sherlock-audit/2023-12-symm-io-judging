# Loss of Funds due to Precision Loss

## Summary
due to the nature of integer division in Solidity, and the handling of token decimals in this contract, there is potential for precision loss that could lead to a loss of funds.
## Vulnerability Detail
deposit(), requestWithdraw() and claimForWithdrawRequest(). The division operation is used to convert from one token's decimal places to another, or to calculate a payback ratio for withdrawal requests.
## Impact
 If a user deposits or withdraws a small amount of tokens, the converted amount could be zero due to precision loss. This would essentially mean that the user's tokens are lost. Additionally, when a withdrawal request is accepted and the payback ratio is computed, precision loss could result in users receiving less than they are supposed to.
## Code Snippet
Here are examples of where this can occur:

In deposit(), the conversion from collateral token decimals to SolverVault token decimals could result in precision loss:
uint256 amountInSolverVaultTokenDecimals = solverVaultTokenDecimals >=
    collateralTokenDecimals
    ? amount * (10 ** (solverVaultTokenDecimals - collateralTokenDecimals))
    : amount / (10 ** (collateralTokenDecimals - solverVaultTokenDecimals));
In requestWithdraw(), the conversion from SolverVault token decimals to collateral token decimals could result in precision loss:
uint256 amountInCollateralDecimals = collateralTokenDecimals >=
    solverVaultTokenDecimals
    ? amount * (10 ** (collateralTokenDecimals - solverVaultTokenDecimals))
    : amount / (10 ** (solverVaultTokenDecimals - collateralTokenDecimals));
In claimForWithdrawRequest(), the calculation of the amount to be withdrawn based on the accepted ratio could result in precision loss:
uint256 amount = (request.amount * request.acceptedRatio) / 1e18;
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
 consider storing and calculating token amounts and ratios in their smallest units (like wei for Ether) to avoid precision loss. This is a standard practice in Solidity contracts.
