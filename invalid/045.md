# Inconsistency and confusing require statement

## Summary

The require statement [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-symm-io/blob/main/solver-vaults/contracts/SolverVaults.sol#L147) is confusing .

## Vulnerability Detail

The `require` statement at [line 147](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-symm-io/blob/main/solver-vaults/contracts/SolverVaults.sol#L147) is so confusing and didn't explicitly defined the developer intended behavior. It was stated that :

```solidity

require(solverVaultTokenDecimals <= 18, "SolverVault: SolverVaultToken decimals should be lower than 18");

```

 while in reality the `require` statement say s that ` " it should be lower than or equal to 18 <="`

if the intended behavior is make sure that its less than `18` , that should have been explicitly outline in the `SolverVaultToken` contract , but that didn't happened, which means its still 18 by default according to `openzepplin` :  

```solidity

 //  Tokens usually opt for a value of 18, imitating the relationship between
 //  Ether and Wei. This is the default value returned by this function, unless
 //  it's overridden.
     *

```

same thing happen  at [line 134 of `updateCollateal`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-symm-io/blob/main/solver-vaults/contracts/SolverVaults.sol#L134) function 

## Impact

Its so confusing on how its suppose to work, an innocent user will not be able to understand the intended behavior of the developers

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

1. If the intention is to make sure it must be lower than 18(i.e 6)  then that must be explicitly said and written in the `require` statement's error message and that must again be explicitly changed to the required `decimals` (e.g 6 and so) in the `SolverVaultToken` contract just like the implementation of `mint` function
2.  If its to make sure that its <= again that must be explicitly written
