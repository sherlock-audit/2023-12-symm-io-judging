# Small amount of solver token's `requestWithdraw` will cause zero collateral token back because of round issue

## Summary
The `amountInCollateralDecimals` value will be zero when user want to `requestwithdraw` a small amount of solver token 

## Vulnerability Detail
I write a simple POC to test this vulnerability .
https://gist.github.com/libaice/b59cce2c5c6a7acf2f0f109850badf3e#file-solvervaulttest-t-sol-L38-L53

```solidity
 function testSmallAmoutWithdraw() public {
        address Alice = makeAddr("Alice");
        vm.startPrank(owner);
        mock_usdc.mint(Alice, 1000000);
        vm.stopPrank();

        vm.startPrank(Alice, Alice);
        // approve vault to spend 1 usdc
        mock_usdc.approve(address(s_vault), 1000000);
        s_vault.deposit(1000000);

        s_token.approve(address(s_vault), 10000);

        s_vault.requestWithdraw(1, Alice);
        vm.stopPrank();
    }
```


We set Alice, the user had already deposited 1 USDC to the `SolverVaults`, and then , he want to withdraw 1 wei(1e-6) USDC back , then the `amountInCollateralDecimals` will be calculated in the `requestWithdraw` method .

we set collateralTokenDecimals = 6, solverVaultTokenDecimals = 18 .

`amountInCollateralDecimals = amount / 10 ** (18 - 6) ` will be Zero

And bolow is the POC test event log
`emit WithdrawRequestEvent(requestId: 0, receiver: Alice: [0xBf0b5A4099F0bf6c8bC4252eBeC548Bae95602Ea], amount: 0)`


## Impact
The solver token had already burned , but user cannot get any collateral token back, thus the user lost all his fund .

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-symm-io/blob/main/solver-vaults/contracts/SolverVaults.sol#L210-L218

```solidity
 uint256 amountInCollateralDecimals = collateralTokenDecimals >=
            solverVaultTokenDecimals
            ? amount *
                (10 ** (collateralTokenDecimals - solverVaultTokenDecimals))
            : amount /
                (10 ** (solverVaultTokenDecimals - collateralTokenDecimals));

        currentDeposit -= amountInCollateralDecimals;

        withdrawRequests.push(
            WithdrawRequest({
                receiver: receiver,
                amount: amountInCollateralDecimals,
                status: RequestStatus.Pending,
                acceptedRatio: 0
            })
        );
```

## Tool used

Manual Review, Foundry Test


## Recommendation
Add withdraw amount limit , for example, the min withdraw amount of solver token is 1e15 .

```solidity
 function requestWithdraw(
        uint256 amount,
        address receiver
    ) external whenNotPaused {
        require(
            SolverVaultToken(solverVaultTokenAddress).balanceOf(msg.sender) >= amount
+           &&  amount >= 1e15,
            "SolverVault: Insufficient token balance"
        );
```
