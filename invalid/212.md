# Be careful with setSymmioAddress

## Summary
In the `setSymmioAddress` function the `updateCollateral` function is called allowing the `collateralTokenAddress` and the `collateralTokenDecimals` to change. The `collateralTokenDecimals` is used when depositing or making withdrawal request for conversion between collateral and solver vault and this could cause incorrect calculation if the value is changed midway of the deposit-withdrawal cycle.

## Vulnerability Detail
In this test, we can see how it could be done

` it("deposit, withdraw, deposit, withdraw, withapprove, ", async function () {
      await solverVault.connect(user).deposit(wei(1));
      await solverVault.connect(user).deposit(wei(10));

      await solverVault
        .connect(owner)
        .setSymmioAddress(await symmio2.getAddress());

      await solverVault
        .connect(user)
        .requestWithdraw(wei(10), await receiver.getAddress());

      const ppt = await solverVaultToken.connect(user).balanceOf(user);
      console.log("changed", ppt.toString());
    });

    it("deposit, withdraw, deposit, withdraw, withapprove, ", async function () {
      await solverVault.connect(user).deposit(wei(1));
      await solverVault.connect(user).deposit(wei(10));

      await solverVault
        .connect(user)
        .requestWithdraw(wei(10), await receiver.getAddress());

      const ppt = await solverVaultToken.connect(user).balanceOf(user);
      console.log("no change", ppt.toString());
    });
`
## Impact
This could cause the user to withdraw way more or way less of the original value staked in the contract and cause mistrust of stakeholders on Symm

```
 function setSymmioAddress(
        address _symmioAddress
    ) public onlyRole(SETTER_ROLE) {
        require(_symmioAddress != address(0), "SolverVault: Zero address");
        symmio = ISymmio(_symmioAddress);
        address beforeCollateral = collateralTokenAddress;
        updateCollateral();
        require(
            beforeCollateral == collateralTokenAddress ||
                beforeCollateral == address(0),
            "SolverVault: Collateral can not be changed"
        );
        emit SymmioAddressUpdatedEvent(_symmioAddress);
    }


    function updateCollateral() internal {
        collateralTokenAddress = symmio.getCollateral();
        collateralTokenDecimals = IERC20Metadata(collateralTokenAddress)
            .decimals();
        require(
            collateralTokenDecimals <= 18,
            "SolverVault: Collateral decimals should be lower than 18"
        );
    }
