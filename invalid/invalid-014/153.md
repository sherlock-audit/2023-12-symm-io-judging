# Current vaults lack mechanism to handle upgradable tokens

## Summary
Current vaults lacks mechanism to handle USDC/USDT when they are upgraded.
## Vulnerability Detail
USDT and USDC are some of upgradable tokens, allowing the token owners to make modifications to the logic of tokens. Some modifications might potentially break the functionalities of the solver vaults. For example, USDT and USDC might be upgraded to fee-on-transfer tokens; in this case, current solver vaults might not work correctly anymore.
## Impact
Potentially break vaults core functionalities/ loss of funds

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider adding mechanism to detect change in token contracts; if changes are detected, pause/ freeze the vaults until new vault upgrades are made.
