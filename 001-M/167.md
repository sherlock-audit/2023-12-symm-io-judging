# The contracts may not work properly when deployed in Arbitrum L2 Chain as the `PUSH0` OPCODE is not supported

## Summary
Solidity version 0.8.20 or above doesn't support in Arbitrum as the `PUSH0  OPCODE` is not yet supported, but will soon be available. This means that solidity version 0.8.20 or higher can only be used with an evm-version lower than the default `shanghai`.

## Vulnerability Detail

As the project clearly states that the contracts will be deployed on Arbitrum in the [README](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-symm-io/blob/main/README.md#q-on-what-chains-are-the-smart-contracts-going-to-be-deployed). All of the contracts in scope have the version pragma 0.8.20 to above to be compiled. This [new version of the compiler](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/releases/tag/v0.8.20) uses the new PUSH0 opcode introduced in the Shanghai hard fork, which is now the default EVM version in the compiler and the one being currently used to compile the project.

Context: SolverVaults.sol
```js
pragma solidity ^0.8.20;
```
## Impact
Arbitrum Network will not be supported for current solidity version that is used in the contracts.
