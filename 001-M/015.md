# Project may fail to be deployed to chains not compatible with Shanghai hardfork

## Summary
Current settings may produce incompatible bytecode with some of the chains supported by the protocol.
## Vulnerability Detail
The Symm Io protocol supports and targets different chains, such as BNB, Arbitrum, Polygon, Base, opBNB, zkEVM, Optimism. This information is available on the contest page [contest page](https://audits.sherlock.xyz/contests/144).
## Impact
All of the contracts in scope have the version pragma to be compiled using Solidity 0.8.20. This [new version of the compiler](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/releases/tag/v0.8.20) uses the new PUSH0 opcode introduced in the Shanghai hard fork, which is now the default EVM version in the compiler and the one being currently used to compile the project.

This means that the produced bytecode for the different contracts won't be compatible with the chains that don't yet support the Shanghai hard fork.

This could also become a problem if different versions of Solidity are used to compile contracts for different chains. The differences in bytecode between versions can impact the deterministic nature of contract addresses, potentially breaking counterfactuality.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Change the Solidity compiler version to 0.8.19 or define an EVM version, which is compatible across all of the intended chains to be supported by the protocol (see https://book.getfoundry.sh/reference/config/solidity-compiler?highlight=evm_vers#evm_version).
