# requestWithdraw burns user solverVaultToken too early causing them loss of potential rewards

## Summary
requestWithdraw burns user solverVaultToken while their funds are still utilized by the protocol causing them loss of potential rewards

## Vulnerability Detail
The logic in requestWithdraw burns user solverVaultTokens immediately, and then pushes the request to a queue for the balancer to accept. However, while the request is in the queue, the user's collateral is still in the protocol and available for use by the solver, because lockedBalance is only updated when the request is accepted. There is no time limit on when the request is accepted, therefore potentially the request can hang in the queue for an unlimited amount of time, all while the requested funds are still available for the protocol to use. According to the team, users get compensated for the deposit through staking their solverVaultTokens (https://discord.com/channels/812037309376495636/1191765829554020372/1191790739538059334). This means users will be deprived of any potential rewards for the period of time between requesting a withdrawal and it being accepted.

## Impact
Loss of potential rewards and compensation for depositors.
