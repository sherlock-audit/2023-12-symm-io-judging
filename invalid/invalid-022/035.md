# Claimers lose their collateral due to unavailable slippage implementation on withdrawer's minimum acceptedRatio

## Summary
- Imagine 1000$ worth of Smart vault token is burned, but only 800$ worth of collateral token is claimable by the user because the `BALANCER` only accepted that much.
- Its a loss to user, and the protocol should implement the minimum slippage mechanism according to the user but not at the global state level. 
- The SolverVaults contract has a state `minimumPaybackRatio` which has to be met by the balancer who accepts the withdrawal requests. But theres no slippage implentation that's comfortable for the withdrawer.

## Vulnerability Detail

- So role `BALANCER_ROLE` calls [acceptWithdrawRequest](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-symm-io/blob/60ee22a4c598220821385cfb5eee43f40aafd5f1/solver-vaults/contracts/SolverVaults.sol#L236) with a `_paybackRatio` parameter which should be higher than the `minimumPaybackRatio` state.
- But if the minimumPaybackRatio is 0.8e18, now the balancer can accept the request with any ratio  above than 0.8e18. Bu the rest 0.2e18 will be a loss to that user. 
- And there's no way to request again because the amount of solerVaultTkes are already burnt in the user's `requestWithdraw` call.

## Impact
Loss of funds to users due to missing slippage implementation

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

- Burn at the [claimForWithdrawRequest](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-symm-io/blob/60ee22a4c598220821385cfb5eee43f40aafd5f1/solver-vaults/contracts/SolverVaults.sol#L282)  transaction but not at `requestWithdraw`, that too only the amount paid back by the solver.
- Or, implement a slippage minimum accepted payBack ratio according to user.

```diff
    function requestWithdraw(uint256 amount, address receiver ) external whenNotPaused {
        require( SolverVaultToken(solverVaultTokenAddress).balanceOf(msg.sender) >=  amount,"SolverVault: Insufficient token balance");
-       SolverVaultToken(solverVaultTokenAddress).burnFrom(msg.sender, amount);

        uint256 amountInCollateralDecimals = collateralTokenDecimals >= solverVaultTokenDecimals
            ? amount *(10 ** (collateralTokenDecimals - solverVaultTokenDecimals))
            : amount /(10 ** (solverVaultTokenDecimals - collateralTokenDecimals));

        currentDeposit -= amountInCollateralDecimals;

        withdrawRequests.push(
            WithdrawRequest({
                receiver: receiver,
                amount: amountInCollateralDecimals,
                status: RequestStatus.Pending,
                acceptedRatio: 0
            })
        );
    }


    function claimForWithdrawRequest(uint256 requestId) external whenNotPaused {
        require(requestId < withdrawRequests.length,"SolverVault: Invalid request ID");
        WithdrawRequest storage request = withdrawRequests[requestId];

        require(request.status == RequestStatus.Ready,"SolverVault: Request not ready for withdrawal");

        request.status = RequestStatus.Done;
        uint256 amount = (request.amount * request.acceptedRatio) / 1e18;
        lockedBalance -= amount;
+       SolverVaultToken(solverVaultTokenAddress).burnFrom(request.receiver, amount);
        IERC20(collateralTokenAddress).safeTransfer(request.receiver, amount);
    }
```
