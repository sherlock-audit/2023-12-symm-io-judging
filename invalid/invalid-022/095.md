# A user can claim a withdrawal request and receive more than he initially deposited

## Summary
Once a user deposits to `SolverVault` and after he requests a withdrawal, if the balancer accepts it with a wrong `_paybackRatio` it will cause the user to receive more amount of collateral tokens than he initially deposited.

## Vulnerability Detail
For users to be able to get back their collateral, they first need to call the `requestWithdraw` and send the `SolverVaultToken`. After that, the BALANCER accepts the withdrawal requests specifying the `_paybackRatio` and sending an additional amount of collateral if needed to cover the withdraws. 
The protocol assumes that the `_paybackRatio` can vary from `minimumPaybackRatio` to `1e18` as `1e18` signifies the 100% ratio. However, the current implementation of `acceptWithdrawRequest` **does not check for a maximum value of the `_paybackRatio` input** in which the BALANCER can mistakenly specify `_paybackRatio` greater than `1e18` (more than 100%) making users withdrawing more collateral amount than they initially deposited.

The following PoC demonstrates that a user can potentially withdraw more collateral amounts than he initially deposited if the BALANCER falls into the mistake of providing `_paybackRatio` more than `1e18`
#### PoC
```js
describe("SolverVault", function () {
  describe("PoC", () => {
    it("A user can withdraw more than he deposited if _paybackRation isn't set correctly", async function () {
        // The deposit amount: 100 tokens of the collateral
        const depositAmount: any = decimal(100, collateralDecimals)
        const amountInVaultTokens = convertToVaultDecimals(depositAmount)
        
        // deposit
        await mintFor(user, depositAmount)
        await solverVault.connect(user).deposit(depositAmount)
                
        // request a full withdraw
        await solverVaultToken.connect(user).approve(await solverVault.getAddress(), amountInVaultTokens)
        const rec = await receiver.getAddress()
        await solverVault.connect(user).requestWithdraw(amountInVaultTokens, rec)
    
        // minPaybackRation is set already to = 500000000000000000n = 0.5 (5 * 1e17) . It is set up there in the beforeEach
               
       // Balancer accepts the withdraw (he can accept many withdraws at once) and sends `providedAmount` to cover all the withdraws if needed.
      // We suppose the providedAmount is needed
      const providedAmount = depositAmount * BigInt(10)
      await mintFor(balancer, providedAmount)
      await collateralToken.connect(balancer).approve(solverVault.getAddress(), providedAmount)
                
      const paybackRatio = decimal(1, 19n) // balancer can send paybakRatio of 1 * 1e19
      await solverVault.connect(balancer).acceptWithdrawRequest(providedAmount, [0], paybackRatio)
      const withdrawRequest = await solverVault.withdrawRequests(0)
      expect(withdrawRequest[3]).to.equal(paybackRatio)
      expect(withdrawRequest[2]).to.equal(RequestStatus.Ready)
    
      // claimForWithdrawRequest
      await (solverVault.connect(receiver).claimForWithdrawRequest(0))
                       
      const balanceOfReceiver = await collateralToken.balanceOf(await receiver.getAddress())
      // audit-danger The receiver receives 10 times more than the initial deposit
      expect(balanceOfReceiver).to.be.equal(depositAmount * BigInt(10));
    })
  }
}

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider checking that the `_paybackRation` is lower than 1e18. Below is an example fix:
```solidity
function acceptWithdrawRequest(
        uint256 providedAmount,
        uint256[] memory _acceptedRequestIds,
        uint256 _paybackRatio
    ) external onlyRole(BALANCER_ROLE) whenNotPaused {
        IERC20(collateralTokenAddress).safeTransferFrom(
            msg.sender,
            address(this),
            providedAmount
        );
        require(
            _paybackRatio >= minimumPaybackRatio,
            "SolverVault: Payback ratio is too low"
        );
        // audit-fix
        require(_paybackRatio <= 1e18, "SolverVault: Payback ratio is too high");
        ...
```
