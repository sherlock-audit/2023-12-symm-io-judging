# Locked tokens caused by conversion error in `function deposit(uint256 amount)`

## Summary

High impact vulnerability that results in user's collateral being locked in the contract.

As indicated by Navid (Official SYMM IO monitor for the contest), this bug should be considered valid because "The contract is written without any assumption about the decimals of both collateral or solverToken".

The vulnerable code identified below clearly indicates that the contract should be compatible with vault/collateral token combinations where the vault token decimal precision is larger than the collateral token decimal precision, as well as any other combination.

The issue can be found in the `function deposit(uint256 amount)` function of the SolverVaults.sol file. 

If the magnitude of the decimal precision of the `solverVaultToken` is larger than the decimal precision of the collateral token, then a significant rounding error occurs due to the calculation for converting between tokens. When a number is divided by a larger number, the result is a fractional value. These cannot exist in solidity, and so solidity rounds the fraction to zero. This can cause collateral tokens to become locked in the contract, because the user's collateral balance is not updated accurately. 

## Vulnerability Detail

The offending function, `deposit(uint256 amount)` from SolverVaults.sol is below. Specifically, the calculation for  `amountInSolverVaultTokenDecimals` is what causes the issue.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-symm-io/blob/main/solver-vaults/contracts/SolverVaults.sol#L158

```solidity
function deposit(uint256 amount) external whenNotPaused {
        require(
            currentDeposit + amount <= depositLimit,
            "SolverVault: Deposit limit reached"
        );
        IERC20(collateralTokenAddress).safeTransferFrom(
            msg.sender,
            address(this),
            amount
        );
        uint256 amountInSolverVaultTokenDecimals = solverVaultTokenDecimals >=
            collateralTokenDecimals
            ? amount *
                (10 ** (solverVaultTokenDecimals - collateralTokenDecimals))
            : amount /
                (10 ** (collateralTokenDecimals - solverVaultTokenDecimals));

        SolverVaultToken(solverVaultTokenAddress).mint(
            msg.sender,
            amountInSolverVaultTokenDecimals
        );
        currentDeposit += amount;
        emit Deposit(msg.sender, amount);
    }
```

In the `function deposit(uint256 amount)` of the contract, users can deposit collateral tokens in order to receive SolverVaultTokens. 

According to the implementation of this function, it should provide a dynamic conversion to maintain value equivalency across tokens with different decimal representations.

However, if the magnitude of the decimal precision of the `solverVaultToken` is larger than the decimal precision of the collateral token, then a significant rounding error occurs.

The root of this vulnerability is the conversion between the amount of collateral passed into the function and the amount of solverVaultToken (`amountInSolverVaultTokenDecimals`) that is calculated.

The issue lies in this path of the `amountInSolverVaultTokenDecimals` calculation:

```solidity
int256 amountInSolverVaultTokenDecimals = amount / (10 ** (collateralTokenDecimals - solverVaultTokenDecimals));
```
If the user wants to convert `amount = 1`, and `collateralTokenDecimals = 18` and `solverVaultTokenDecimals = 6`, then `amountInSolverVaultTokenDecimals = 1x10**-12`. A negative exponent indicates a fractional number. 

In solidity, there are no floating point types and therefore no fractional numbers. Any fractional numbers are rounded down to zero in solidity.

Therefore, a solverVaultToken with a greater decimal precision than the collateral token will result in a negative exponent, which is rounded down to 0.

With the example values given above, the depositor could deposit up to 999,999,999,999 collateral tokens before a balance is registered, and this balance registered will clearly be hugely inaccurate.

In the `requestWithdraw(uint256 amount, address receiver)` found in the SolverVaults.sol contract (https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-symm-io/blob/main/solver-vaults/contracts/SolverVaults.sol#L201) the user can request to withdraw their collateral by specifying an amount of SolverVaultTokens to exchange. In this function in the contract code, note the line:

 ```solidity
require(
            SolverVaultToken(solverVaultTokenAddress).balanceOf(msg.sender) >= amount,
            "SolverVault: Insufficient token balance"
        );
```

The result of this is that the depositor will have their collateral tokens locked in the SolverVault contract as their balance is incorrectly registered as 0, and the impact of this is significant if a large amount (or many small amounts) of collateral are deposited.

The tokens are locked because the `amountInSolverVaultTokenDecimals` will be rounded down to zero. This value is used for minting SolverVaultTokens in the deposit function, and so 0 tokens will be minted for the depositor, and their SolverVaultToken balance will remain at 0. SolverVaultTokens are required to withdraw the collateral, and so without these tokens, the user cannot withdraw their collateral.

## Impact

High - It results in collateral locked in the contract for users.

## Code Snippet

Below is a Foundry test PoC that proves that this is a vulnerability, and tokens are locked in the contract:

```solidity
function setUp() public {
        owner = makeAddress("owner");
        testUser = makeAddress("testUser");
        vm.startPrank(owner);
        // Deploy MockERC20 contract with 18 decimals
        collateralToken = new MockERC20(18);

        // Deploy MockSymmio contract
        // Takes MockERC20 decimals as constructor argument
        symmio = new MockSymmio(address(collateralToken));

        // Deploy POC1_SolverVaultToken contract
        // This contract is exactly the same as SolverVaultToken, except it has 6 decimals
        sVT = new POC1_SolverVaultToken();

        // Deploy SolverVaults contractio
        // - uint _depositLimit
        solver = makeAddress("solver");
        uint256 minimumPaybackRatio = 500_000_000_000_000_000; // 0.5%

        sVImp = new SolverVault();

        // Deploy proxy
        TransparentUpgradeableProxy p = new TransparentUpgradeableProxy(
            address(sVImp),
            address(owner),""
        );

        proxy = address(p);

        // Initialize proxy
        sV = SolverVault(payable(proxy));
        sV.initialize(address(symmio), address(sVT), solver, minimumPaybackRatio, 1000 ether);

        // Set sV proxy as minter for sVT
        sVT.grantRole(sVT.MINTER_ROLE(), proxy);

        // Distribute ether and tokens
        vm.deal(owner, 10 ether);
        vm.deal(testUser, 10 ether);
        collateralToken.mint(testUser, 1000 ether);
        vm.stopPrank();
    }

    function test_depositTokensLocked() public {
        // Balance of testUser collateralTokens before deposit
        uint256 balanceCTBefore = collateralToken.balanceOf(testUser);
        // Deposit large amount of collateralTokens
        vm.startPrank(testUser);
        uint256 depositAmount = 999999999999;
        collateralToken.approve(address(sV), 1000000000000000000000);
        sV.deposit(999999999999);

        // Prove that SolverVaultToken balance of testUser is 0, but the CollateralToken balance has decreased
        uint256 balanceSVT = poc_sVT.balanceOf(testUser);
        assertEq(balanceSVT, 0);
        uint256 balanceCTAfter = collateralToken.balanceOf(testUser);
        uint256 calculatedBalanceCT = balanceCTBefore - depositAmount;
        assertEq(calculatedBalanceCT, balanceCTAfter);
        // Since the SVT balance is 0, the user cannot withdraw their collateral!
        vm.stopPrank();
    }
    ```

In the `setup()` function above, we see that a SolverVaultToken contract with 6 decimals and a CollateralToken contract with 18 decimals are deployed. In the `test_depositTokensLocked()` function, a user deposits a large sum of collateral tokens, however their balance remains at 0. Therefore, they are unable to withdraw their collateral, because the `requestWithdraw(uint256 amount, address receiver)` requires a balance of SVT equal to or greater than the amount they would like to withdraw!

Manual Review

## Recommendation

To prevent this there are a couple solutions. Firstly, the bounty spec suggests that this contract should only be used for USDC and USDT as the ERC20 tokens, both of which have 6 decimal precision. The decimal precision of the collateral tokens and the SolverVaultTokens are set in the functions `updateCollateral()` and `setSymmioVaultTokenAddress(address _symmioVaultTokenAddress)`. These could be updated to ensure that the correct decimal precisions are used:

```solidity
function updateCollateral() internal {
        collateralTokenAddress = symmio.getCollateral();
        collateralTokenDecimals = IERC20Metadata(collateralTokenAddress).decimals();
        require(collateralTokenDecimals == 6, "SolverVault: Collateral decimals should be 6");
    }

    function setSymmioVaultTokenAddress(address _symmioVaultTokenAddress) internal {
        require(_symmioVaultTokenAddress != address(0), "SolverVault: Zero address");
        solverVaultTokenAddress = _symmioVaultTokenAddress;
        solverVaultTokenDecimals = SolverVaultToken(_symmioVaultTokenAddress).decimals();
        require(solverVaultTokenDecimals == 18, "SolverVault: SolverVaultToken decimals should be 18");
    }
```
Alternatively, if a dynamic conversion must be maintained, then this function can achieve this:

```solidity
function calculateTokenBAmountFromTokenAAmount(uint256 amountOfTokenA, uint8 tokenADecimals, uint8 tokenBDecimals)
        internal
        pure
        returns (uint256)
    {
        if (tokenADecimals == tokenBDecimals) {
            // If the decimals are the same, no adjustment is needed.
            return amountOfTokenA;
        } else if (tokenADecimals > tokenBDecimals) {
            // If tokenA has more decimals, scale down.
            uint256 scaleDownFactor = 10 ** (tokenADecimals - tokenBDecimals);
            return amountOfTokenA / scaleDownFactor;
        } else {
            // If tokenB has more decimals, scale up.
            uint256 scaleUpFactor = 10 ** (tokenBDecimals - tokenADecimals);
            return amountOfTokenA * scaleUpFactor;
        }
    }
```
