# Absence of Minimum Deposit and Withdrawal Amounts Enables Potential Denial-of-Service Exploits

## Summary
Without a minimum deposit and withdrawal requirement, the system is vulnerable to issues caused by handling very small transactions ('dust'). This could lead to wrong calculations and even make it easier for attackers to flood the network with tiny transactions, causing disruptions.

## Vulnerability Detail
By allowing tiny transactions ('dust') without any rules, the system might run into problems like wrong calculations due to handling extremely small amounts. Attackers could exploit this by overwhelming the system with countless insignificant transactions.
## Impact
Calculation Errors: Dealing with these small transactions can mess up the system's calculations and cause mistakes.
Network Congestion: Floods of tiny transactions could clog up the system, causing slowdowns or disruptions for legitimate users.
## Code Snippet
As you can see there's no min amount required to interact with the protocol 
As the protocol has an for loop in **acceptWithdrawRequest()** it will even make it worse in case of a dust attack as its gonna waste a lot of gas

            WithdrawRequest({
                receiver: receiver,
                amount: amountInCollateralDecimals,
                status: RequestStatus.Pending,
                acceptedRatio: 0

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
```solidity
// Assuming oneUSD represents the value of one US Dollar in the relevant token units (e.g., 1 US Dollar = 1 * 10**18 in token decimals)

require(minAmountInOut >= oneUSD, "Amount should be more than one US Dollar");

```
