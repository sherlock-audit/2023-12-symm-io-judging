# Approve in deposit token could revert for non standard token like USDT

## Summary

if the approval is not lowered to exactly 0 , then the next approval in depositToSymmio() will fail (assuming a token like USDT is used), blocking all
further deposits.

## Vulnerability Detail

Some tokens do not implement the ERC20 standard properly but are still accepted by most code that accepts ERC20 tokens. For example Tether (USDT)'s approve() function will revert if the current approval is not zero, to protect against front-running changes of approvals.

## Impact

set the approval to zero after the transfer is done, so that the next approval can go through or it will block further approvals

## Code Snippet


IERC20(collateralTokenAddress).approve(address(symmio), amount),

Adopt a safer approach to cover edge cases such as the abovementioned USDT token or set the allownace to 0
