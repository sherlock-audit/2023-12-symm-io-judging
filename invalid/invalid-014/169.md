# Possibility of breaking core invariant due to the USDC/USDT fee on transfer.

## Summary

The USDT/USDC tokens have an implemented fee on transfer feature that is currently not in use. However, it may be activated in the future. If this happens, a user would receive more vault tokens than the collateral deposited, due to the fee imposed by USDT/USDC.

## Vulnerability Detail

This would violate a core invariant defined in the README file: 

>When users deposit funds, the contract issues vault tokens in a 1:1 ratio with the deposited amount.

It would also result in a loss of funds for the protocol and a profit for the user, as the difference would be covered by the protocol.

```solidity
        IERC20(collateralTokenAddress).safeTransferFrom(
            msg.sender,
            address(this),
            amount
        );
        uint256 amountInSolverVaultTokenDecimals = solverVaultTokenDecimals >=
            collateralTokenDecimals
            ? amount *
                (10 ** (solverVaultTokenDecimals - collateralTokenDecimals))
            : amount /
                (10 ** (collateralTokenDecimals - solverVaultTokenDecimals));

        SolverVaultToken(solverVaultTokenAddress).mint(
            msg.sender,
            amountInSolverVaultTokenDecimals
        );
```

In the above source code can be seen that the vault mints tokens based on the variable `amount` instead of the actual transferred amount. 

## Impact

Breaking core invariant and financial loss for the protocol.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Adjust the deposit function to mint vault tokens based on the actual amount received instead of the `amount` variable. It will cost a little more gas but will prevent more serious problems.
