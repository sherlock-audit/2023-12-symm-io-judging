# Lack of Time Locks in SolverVault::setDepositLimit and Administrative Functions, Resulting in Potential Immediate Unauthorized Actions


## Summary
The contract lacks time locks or delays on sensitive operations. This means that if a role with significant permissions, such as the ability to pause the contract or change critical parameters, is compromised, the attacker can execute potentially damaging actions immediately, without giving stakeholders or users time to react.

## Vulnerability Detail
 In the `SolverVault` contract, functions like `setDepositLimit`, `pause`, and `unpause` can be called by anyone with the appropriate role without any delay.

## Impact
If an attacker gains control of a privileged role, they can immediately execute actions that could disrupt the normal operation of the contract, freeze user funds, or change critical parameters, potentially leading to financial loss or a loss of trust in the system.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
    function setDepositLimit(
        uint256 _depositLimit
    ) public onlyRole(SETTER_ROLE) {
        depositLimit = _depositLimit;
        emit DepositLimitUpdatedEvent(_depositLimit);
    }

    function pause() external onlyRole(PAUSER_ROLE) {
        _pause();
    }

    function unpause() external onlyRole(UNPAUSER_ROLE) {
        _unpause();
    }
```

## Recommendation

One way to fix this would be to use <b>Time locks</b>. Time locks are a security mechanism used in smart contracts to delay sensitive operations, giving users and stakeholders time to prepare for the changes or to take action if the change is malicious (e.g., by exiting the system or by using governance mechanisms to counteract the change).

<details><summary><b>EXAMPLE (time lock)</b></summary> 
To implement a time lock, you can use a modifier that checks whether a sufficient amount of time has passed since the operation was queued. Here's an example of how you might add a time lock to the <i>setDepositLimit</i> function:

```solidity
contract SolverVault {
    // ... existing code ...

    // Define Time Lock Variables:
    // Introduce variables to store the duration of the time lock and the timestamps when actions are queued.
    uint256 public constant TIME_LOCK_DURATION = 2 days;
    mapping(bytes32 => uint256) public timelock;

    event DepositLimitQueued(uint256 depositLimit, uint256 effectiveTime);

    // Create Queueing Functions:
    // For each sensitive function, create a corresponding function to queue the action with a time lock.
    function queueSetDepositLimit(uint256 _depositLimit) public onlyRole(SETTER_ROLE) {
        bytes32 operation = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(_depositLimit));
        timelock[operation] = block.timestamp + TIME_LOCK_DURATION;
        emit DepositLimitQueued(_depositLimit, timelock[operation]);
    }

    // Implement Time Lock Modifier:
    // Create a modifier that checks whether the time lock has expired before allowing the function to execute.
    modifier withTimelock(bytes32 operation) {
        require(timelock[operation] != 0 && timelock[operation] <= block.timestamp, "Operation is timelocked");
        _;
        timelock[operation] = 0; // Clear the timelock after the operation is executed
    }

    // Apply Time Lock Modifier:
    // Apply the time lock modifier to all sensitive functions to enforce the delay.
    function setDepositLimit(
        uint256 _depositLimit
    ) public onlyRole(SETTER_ROLE) withTimelock(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(_depositLimit))) {
        depositLimit = _depositLimit;
        emit DepositLimitUpdatedEvent(_depositLimit);
    }

    // ... existing code ...
}

```

In this example, queueSetDepositLimit is used to queue the operation with a time lock, and setDepositLimit checks the time lock before executing. This pattern can be applied to other sensitive functions to ensure that there is a delay between when an operation is initiated and when it is executed.

By implementing these changes, the contract will have a robust time lock mechanism that helps protect against unauthorized or malicious actions by delaying their execution and giving users and/or stakeholders time to react.
