# The depositLimit can be exceeded thorugh a rentrancy vunerability

## Summary
There is a window for a malicious user to manipulate the deposit function to deposit more than allowed due to a rentrancy exploit, 

## Vulnerability Detail
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-symm-io/blob/main/solver-vaults/contracts/SolverVaults.sol#L158C4-L181C6

When the deposit function is called it deposits collateral tokens and mints solver vaults tokens, but users cant just keep depositing, as there is a deposit limit, but through to a exploit in the code this can be exploited as shown in the snippet below 
```solidity
require(
            currentDeposit + amount <= depositLimit,
            "SolverVault: Deposit limit reached"
        );
//@audit makes sure the amount you are about to deposit and the amount presently deposited does not exceed the limit 
```
The code below makes sure that users can deposit more so the amount of solver tokens minted will not exceed the limit. but if the `currentDeposit` is almost near the depositLimit, a attack can occur to make the amount deposited exceed the limit 

```solidity
 SolverVaultToken(solverVaultTokenAddress).mint(
            msg.sender,
            amountInSolverVaultTokenDecimals
        );
//@audit after transffering the token to get minted, a malicious user, using a contract can renter into this function
        currentDeposit += amount;
```
After The User renters the function above, they will keep minting and depositing more collateral tokens to mint more vault tokens, because the `currentDeposit += amount;` is updated after the external call, which means that as shown below the function will be using a old `currentDeposit` Parameter, to check if the limit as being reached 

```solidity
require(
            currentDeposit + amount <= depositLimit,
//@audit Here after Rentering the function, it uses the old version of the currentDeposit, which will make the limit to be exceeded
            "SolverVault: Deposit limit reached"
        );
```

## Impact
The Solver will be unable to pay profits as intended if the amount of tokens minted are greater than the limit already set, 

## Code Snippet

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The Code Should Be Rearranged Like This Or A Reentrancy Check should be placed in the function

```solidity
 + currentDeposit += amount;

 SolverVaultToken(solverVaultTokenAddress).mint(
            msg.sender,
            amountInSolverVaultTokenDecimals
        );
```
