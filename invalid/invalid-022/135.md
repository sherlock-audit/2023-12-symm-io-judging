# User Should Allowed To Specify How Much Slippage He/She Can Take

## Summary
See Detail
## Vulnerability Detail
While processing `acceptWithdrawRequest()` `_paybackRatio` is passed by `BALANCER_ROLE`
There is a check which ensure that `_paybackRatio` must >= to `minimumPaybackRatio`
```solidity
 require(
            _paybackRatio >= minimumPaybackRatio,
```
`minimumPaybackRatio` set during initialization, and will never change futher

So point is it could set initialy to any number(in test set to 70%), And while initiating a withdraw it completely depends on `BALANCER_ROLE` to specify how much `_paybackRatio` he will intended to give, depending on it withdrawal amount will be calculated as follows
```solidity
uint256 amount = (request.amount * request.acceptedRatio) / 1e18;
```

But the thing is, User may not satisfied with output amount, as  `_paybackRatio` set by `BALANCER_ROLE` is not enough for him.
Let say while processing `BALANCER_ROLE` _paybackRatio to minimumPaybackRatio and user not aware of that and in result receive less fund than he imagine.
## Impact
User will receive less fund than he imagined.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Should there a slippage paramater where user can pass how much `_paybackRatio` he want, if `BALANCER_ROLE` pass less than that then Tx get reverted.
