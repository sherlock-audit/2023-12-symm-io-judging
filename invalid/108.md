# Deposits can be accidentally locked via acceptWithdrawRequest

## Summary

Because anyone can withdraw tokens via claimForWithdrawRequest() thus changing the contract's collateral token balance throughout the lifecycle of the block, it is possible for acceptWithdrawRequest() to accidentally lock up deposits meant to be deposited to the Symm contract. 



## Vulnerability Detail

The core of this problem has to do with internal accounting. The protocol does not differentiate tokens allocated for depositing vs tokens allocated for withdrawing. Because of this mix bag, acceptWithdrawRequest() runs the risk of either reverting or locking funds intended to be deposited into the Symm contract.  

Consider an example where a Balancer (which according to the [Navid](https://discord.com/channels/812037309376495636/1191765829554020372/1192091803395051590) can be a person) decides to call acceptWithdrawRequest() but a withdraw occurs before acceptWithdrawRequest() changing the collateral token balance:

### Example #1 - DOS

In this example, we see a simple DOS scenario where the Balancer did not submit enough funds in providedAmount causing a revert.

#### Step 1 - claimForWithdrawRequest() called

BEFORE CALL:
collateralTokenBalance = 1500

claimForWithdrawRequest(1500) called

AFTER CALL:
collateralTokenBalance = 0

#### Step 2 - acceptWithdrawRequest() called

BEFORE CALL:
collateralTokenBalance = 0

acceptWithdrawRequest(1000, [1], 1.5e18) called

AFTER CALL:
providedAmount = 1000
payback_ratio = 150%
withdrawRequest.amount = 1000
totalRequiredBalance = 1500
collateralTokenBalance = 1000

#### Results - acceptWithdrawRequest() reverts

```solidity
require(
    collateralTokenBalance >= totalRequiredBalance,
    "SolverVault: Insufficient contract balance"
);
```


which is based on Step 2 state changes

```solidity
require(
    1000 >= 1500,
    "SolverVault: Insufficient contract balance"
);
```


### Example #2 - Deposits Accidentally Locked

In this example deposits allocated for Symm deposit will accidentally be locked up. Again this will be due to a user frontrunning the call and adjusting the collateral token balance before acceptWithdrawRequest() is called.

#### Step 1 - claimForWithdrawRequest() called

BEFORE CALL:
lockedBalance = 1000
collateralTokenBalance = 1500

claimForWithdrawRequest(750) called

AFTER CALL:
collateralTokenBalance = 750
lockedBalance = 250

#### Step 2 - acceptWithdrawRequest() called

BEFORE CALL:
collateralTokenBalance = 750
lockedBalance = 250

acceptWithdrawRequest(400, [1], 1.5e18) called

AFTER CALL:
providedAmount = 400
payback_ratio = 150%
withdrawRequest.amount = 500
totalRequiredBalance = 750
lockedBalance = 1000
collateralTokenBalance = 1150

#### Results - acceptWithdrawRequest() decreases deposits meant for Symm

BEFORE acceptWithdrawRequest():

```solidity
notLockedUp = collateralTokenBalance - lockedBalance
notLockedUp = 1500 - 1000
notLockedUp = 500
```

AFTER acceptWithdrawRequest():

```solidity
notLockedUp = 1150 - 1000
notLockedUp = 115
notLockedUp = 115
```

## Impact

Deposited funds meant to be allocated to Symm may be locked up and require additional funds from the Balancer contract to counter-balance. By locking up more deposits than necessary, the vault will lose out on rewards until the protocol can counter-balance the deposit offset.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

A check should be added ensuring that the providedAmount should be equal or greater than the delta change that occurs in the lockedBalance.

```solidity
function acceptWithdrawRequest(
    uint256 providedAmount,
    uint256[] memory _acceptedRequestIds,
    uint256 _paybackRatio
) external onlyRole(BALANCER_ROLE) whenNotPaused {
    IERC20(collateralTokenAddress).safeTransferFrom(
        msg.sender,
        address(this),
        providedAmount
    );
    require(
        _paybackRatio >= minimumPaybackRatio,
        "SolverVault: Payback ratio is too low"
    );
    uint256 totalRequiredBalance = lockedBalance;

    for (uint256 i = 0; i < _acceptedRequestIds.length; i++) {
        uint256 id = _acceptedRequestIds[i];
        require(
            id < withdrawRequests.length,
            "SolverVault: Invalid request ID"
        );
        require(
            withdrawRequests[id].status == RequestStatus.Pending,
            "SolverVault: Invalid accepted request"
        );
        totalRequiredBalance +=
            (withdrawRequests[id].amount * _paybackRatio) /
            1e18;
        withdrawRequests[id].status = RequestStatus.Ready;
        withdrawRequests[id].acceptedRatio = _paybackRatio;
    }

    require(
        IERC20(collateralTokenAddress).balanceOf(address(this)) >=
            totalRequiredBalance,
        "SolverVault: Insufficient contract balance"
    );

    // AUDIT: add necessary check here ensuring that the providedAmount can cover the totalRequiredBalance
    require(providedAmount >= totalRequiredBalance, "Balancer has not provided enough funds")
    lockedBalance = totalRequiredBalance;
    emit WithdrawRequestAcceptedEvent(
        providedAmount,
        _acceptedRequestIds,
        _paybackRatio
    );
}
```
