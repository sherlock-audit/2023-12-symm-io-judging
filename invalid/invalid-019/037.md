# Incorrect calculation of amount lockedUp leading to issues and disruptions in the contract's normal operation

## Summary
A vulnerability has been identified in the `SolverVault::acceptWithdrawRequest` function, where the calculation of the `amount locked up` is incorrect. This vulnerability is identifed when `collateralTokenDecimals == solverVaultTokenDecimals` as there is no provision to calculate for variation in `collateralTokenDecimals and solverVaultTokenDecimals`

## Vulnerability Detail
The amountLockedUp variable is inaccurately calculated within the `SolverVault::acceptWithdrawRequest` function. This variable is crucial as it is utilized in both the `SolverVault::claimForWithdrawRequest` and `SolverVault::depositToSymmio` functions, playing a significant role in the overall contract functionality.

## Impact
The miscalculation of the amountLockedUp variable has a direct impact on the `SolverVault::claimForWithdrawRequest` and `SolverVault::depositToSymmio` functions, potentially leading to  issues and disruptions in the contract's normal operation.

## Proof of Concept 
```solidity 
function testLockedBalance(uint64 amount) public {
        uint256 newAmount = bound(amount, 10 ether, type(uint64).max);
        vm.startPrank(userA);
        USDT.approve(address(SV), USDT.balanceOf(userA));
        uint inititalBalance = USDT.balanceOf(address(userA));
        SV.deposit(newAmount); 
      

        SVT.approve(address(SV), SVT.balanceOf(userA));

        SV.requestWithdraw(newAmount, userA);
        vm.stopPrank();

        vm.startPrank(user);
        // SV.depositToSymmio(newAmount);

        uint256[] memory acceptedRequestIds = new uint256[](1);
        acceptedRequestIds[0] = 0;
        USDT.approve(address(SV), USDT.balanceOf(user));

        SV.acceptWithdrawRequest(newAmount, acceptedRequestIds, 1);
        console.log("locked balance",SV.lockedBalance());
        console.log("amount deposited", newAmount);
        assert(SV.lockedBalance() == newAmount);
        
        vm.stopPrank();
    }
```
## logs 
```solidity
  initial usdt balance of user  340282366920938463463374607431768211455
  balance of vault after first deposit 10000000000000000000
  locked balance 10
  amount deposited 10000000000000000000
```
## Tool used
Fuzz Test
Manual Review

## Recommendation
It is recommended to conduct a thorough review and correction of the SolverVault::acceptWithdrawRequest function to rectify the inaccurate calculation of the amountLockedUp variable To accomodate situations where  `collateralTokenDecimals >= solverVaultTokenDecimals` and vice versa
