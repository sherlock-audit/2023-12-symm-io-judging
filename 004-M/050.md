# Precision loss when vault decimals are less than collateral decimals

## Summary

Downscaling the collateral amount to transform it to vault tokens will cause a loss of funds proportional to the magnitude of the decimals difference.

## Vulnerability Detail

When a user deposits collateral tokens in SolverVault they are minted vault tokens. To address any potential difference in decimals between both tokens, the amount is upscaled or downscaled depending on the direction of the difference.

When the collateral token decimals are greater than the vault token decimals, the deposit amount is downscaled according to the following formula: `amount / (10 ** (collateralTokenDecimals - solverVaultTokenDecimals))`. 

For example, if `collateralTokenDecimals = 18` and `solverVaultTokenDecimals = 10`, then `amountInSolverVaultTokenDecimals = amount / (10 ** 10)`, taking a precision loss of up to `10**10 - 1` when this amount gets upscaled back in `requestWithdraw()`.

## Impact

When `collateralTokenDecimals > solverVaultTokenDecimals`, deposit amounts will suffer a loss of value of up to `10**(collateralTokenDecimals - solverVaultTokenDecimals) - 1`.

Additionally, deposit tracking implemented in `currentDeposit` will be broken, as these will be added using the original amount in `deposit()`, but subtracted the downscaled amount in `requestWithdraw()`.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Ensure the decimals of the vault token are always greater or equal than the decimals of the collateral token. This way, deposits will only be upscaled, meaning no precision loss will be taken during the deposit -> withdrawal cycle.
