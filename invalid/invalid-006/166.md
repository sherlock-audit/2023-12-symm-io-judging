# SolverVaults contract will not work correctly if used with a token that has fee on transfer

## Summary

Many parts of the `SolverVaults` contract will not work as expected if the token used as collateral has a fee on transfer.
The in scope token [USDT](https://etherscan.io/token/0xdac17f958d2ee523a2206206994597c13d831ec7) can have fee on token transfers.

## Vulnerability Detail

When a user deposit collateral into the vault, then he/she provide less amount of assets as it is accounted/minted for. 
Also when the `BALANCER_ROLE` or `DEPOSITOR_ROLE` when they move collateral around there will be less tokens then accounted for.
Which can further be a problem on withdrawals becouse there is less balance than accounted for.

## Impact

`SolverVaults` contract will not correctly work if collateral token uses fee on transfers.

## Code Snippet

The [USDT](https://etherscan.io/token/0xdac17f958d2ee523a2206206994597c13d831ec7) token can have a fee asoctiated on every token transfer :

https://etherscan.io/token/0xdac17f958d2ee523a2206206994597c13d831ec7#code#L126

```solidity
    /**
    * @dev transfer token for a specified address
    * @param _to The address to transfer to.
    * @param _value The amount to be transferred.
    */
    function transfer(address _to, uint _value) public onlyPayloadSize(2 * 32) {
        uint fee = (_value.mul(basisPointsRate)).div(10000);
        if (fee > maximumFee) {
            fee = maximumFee;
        }
        ...
```

and https://etherscan.io/token/0xdac17f958d2ee523a2206206994597c13d831ec7#code#L171

```solidity
    function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint _value) public onlyPayloadSize(3 * 32) {
        var _allowance = allowed[_from][msg.sender];

        // Check is not needed because sub(_allowance, _value) will already throw if this condition is not met
        // if (_value > _allowance) throw;

        uint fee = (_value.mul(basisPointsRate)).div(10000);
        if (fee > maximumFee) {
            fee = maximumFee;
        }
        if (_allowance < MAX_UINT) {
            allowed[_from][msg.sender] = _allowance.sub(_value);
        }
        uint sendAmount = _value.sub(fee);
        ...
```

Here are some scenarios where the fee on transfer can cause problems when using the `SolverVaults` contract :

On deposit there is no accounting for transfer fee and the `amount` is directly used to mint `SolverVaultToken` tokens :

The minting is done as 1:1 token ratio but is not correct if the fee has been used:

When the `BALANCER` account provides liquidity for the withdrawal requests its `providedAmount` will be a fee short then intended :

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-symm-io/blob/main/solver-vaults/contracts/SolverVaults.sol#L241-L245


When the `DEPOSITOR` account will try to forward `amount` value to the solver. There could be less value forwarded becouse the fee on transfer :

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-symm-io/blob/main/solver-vaults/contracts/SolverVaults.sol#L197

When the user wishes to `claim` the previous accepted withdrawal request. He/she will get less then expected becouse the transfer fee. Reverts could be also possible if the contract is low on collateral :

## Recommendation

Consider not using such tokens or implementing correct accounting logic for them.
