# the implementation of `SolverVault` can be initialized and controlled by anyone

## Summary
Anyone could potentially take over the implementation of `SolverVault` by calling its `initialize()` function 
## Vulnerability Detail
`SolverVault` is an upgradable contract. Once deployed, it will be used as an implementation of a proxy contract.  However, when the proxy contract is deployed and initialized, the implementation has never been initialized.  Anyone can call `SolverVault#initialize()` to take over the implementation.
## Impact
While it's currently challenging to outline specific attack vectors, the situation leaves a considerable opportunity for a malicious user to exploit potential scenarios: 
1. If somehow the implementation was granted `MINTER_ROLE` by `SolverVaultToken`, malicious user may have chance to drain collateral assets in the proxy contract by minting `SolverVaultToken` and redeem collateral assets with minted `SolverVaultToken`
2. Malicious may have chance to block all functions by destructing the implementation if some new features are introduced.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Call `_disableInitializers()` in constructor function:
```diff
+   constructor() {
+      _disableInitializers();
+   }
```
