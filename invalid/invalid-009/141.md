# Do not leave proxy implementations uninitialized

## Summary

Do not leave proxy implementations uninitialized 

## Vulnerability Detail

Do not leave an implementation contract uninitialized. An uninitialized implementation contract can be taken over by an attacker, which may impact the proxy.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

To prevent the implementation contract from being used, you should invoke the _disableInitializers function in the constructor to automatically lock it when it is deployed:

```solidity
constructor() {
    _disableInitializers();
}
```

By putting it in the constructor, this prevents initialization of the implementation contract itself, as extra protection [to prevent an attacker from initializing it 76](https://forum.openzeppelin.com/t/uupsupgradeable-vulnerability-post-mortem/15680).
