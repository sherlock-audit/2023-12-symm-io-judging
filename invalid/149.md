# currentDeposit is always deducted with the full amount of withdrawal

## Summary
The actual collateral token amount deposited from user may be returned lesser than the original amount as it depends on the `_paybackRatio` defined by the `BALANCER`. However, `currentDeposit` is always deducted with the original amount when a user `requestWithdraw()`.

## Vulnerability Detail
Whenever a user `requestWithdraw()` successfully, `currentDeposit` is deducted with the full amount as requested from the user:

```solidity
219        currentDeposit -= amountInCollateralDecimals;
```

But the `BALANCER` may decrease the `_paybackRatio` which in return giving back the collateral token amount lesser than the original amount.

```solidity
295        uint256 amount = (request.amount * request.acceptedRatio) / 1e18;
```

Below is the POC to show the different between `currentDeposit` and the actual amount of deposited collateral token from user when the `BALANCER` sets the `_paybackRatio` as **0.7**
(Please put this case at the same level as describe("requestWithdraw") in SolverVault.test.ts so that it has all the needed value to run)

## Impact
As mentioned in the [README.md](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-symm-io/blob/main/solver-vaults/README.md), `currentDeposit` plays as a guard which limits the total amount users can put into contract. Since the `currentDeposit` may lesser than the actual amount existing in the contract, users may take benefit from this as they can continue to deposit to get Solver Vault Token beyond the intention of the protocol for staking purpose, etc...

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider deducting `currentDeposit` with the actual amount of collateral token to be returned by the BALANCER in `acceptWithdrawRequest()`:

- delete the deduct of `currentDeposit` in `requestWithdraw()`

```solidity
- 219        currentDeposit -= amountInCollateralDecimals;
```
- calculate the currentDeposit directly in acceptWithdrawRequest()
```solidity
+ 265          currentDeposit -= 
+ 266               (withdrawRequests[id].amount * _paybackRatio) / 
+ 267                1e18;
```
