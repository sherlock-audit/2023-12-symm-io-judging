# Possible reentrancy allows depositing over the deposit limit

## Summary
The contract is meant to be used with USDT and USDC tokens on BNB, Arbitrum, Polygon, Base, opBNB, zkEVM, Optimism. Most of these tokens are upgradable proxies. This means that at any point in time a transfer hook may be added to these tokens. Using this transfer hook, anyone will be able to bypass the depositLimit.

## Vulnerability Detail
[`SolverVaults.deposit()`](https://github.com/SYMM-IO/solver-vaults/blob/4bdebbecb66e29ac18e5a5c9eda42e4cb44cdd65/contracts/SolverVaults.sol#L158-L181) does not follow the CEI pattern. It: 
 1. requires that the depositLimit will not be surpassed
 2. transfer the collateral token from the user to itself
 3. updates the variable that tracks the total deposits at the very end

An USDC/USDT token that implements a `_beforeTokenTransfer` or `_afterTokenTransfer` hook may be used to hijack the execution flow and call deposit again, between step 2 and 3. The require statement will be bypassed because `currentDeposit` will not be updated. Now a malicious user can mint more tokens than allowed.
```solidity
        require(
            currentDeposit + amount <= depositLimit,
            "SolverVault: Deposit limit reached"
        );
```

## Impact
Depositing over `depositLimit`. This will cause more vault tokens to be in circulation than expected.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
    function deposit(uint256 amount) external whenNotPaused {
        require(
            currentDeposit + amount <= depositLimit,
            "SolverVault: Deposit limit reached"
        );
        IERC20(collateralTokenAddress).safeTransferFrom(
            msg.sender,
            address(this),
            amount
        );
      
       (...)

        currentDeposit += amount;
        emit Deposit(msg.sender, amount);
    }
```

## Recommendation
Rewrite `SolverVaults.deposit()` to follow the CEI pattern.
