# Inadequate Safeguard for `_paybackRatio` in `acceptWithdrawRequest`

## Summary

The code lacks a crucial check to ensure that the `_paybackRatio` variable remains below 1e18. Although the initialization function `initialize` correctly validates that `_minimumPaybackRatio` is less than or equal to 1e18, the corresponding validation is absent in the `acceptWithdrawRequest` function. Despite checking that `_paybackRatio` is greater than `_minimumPaybackRatio`, it fails to confirm that it does not exceed 1e18.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the `acceptWithdrawRequest` function, there is a missing verification for the upper limit of `_paybackRatio`. The absence of this check introduces a potential risk where users may receive more tokens than initially deposited.

## Impact

The absence of this check poses a risk of financial loss for the protocol, as users may receive more tokens than initially deposited.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
function acceptWithdrawRequest(
    uint256 providedAmount,
    uint256[] memory _acceptedRequestIds,
    uint256 _paybackRatio
) external onlyRole(BALANCER_ROLE) whenNotPaused {
    IERC20(collateralTokenAddress).safeTransferFrom(
        msg.sender,
        address(this),
        providedAmount
    );
    require(
        _paybackRatio >= minimumPaybackRatio,
        "SolverVault: Payback ratio is too low"
    );
    // Missing check for _paybackRatio <= 1e18
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

To address this vulnerability, it is strongly recommended to include a validation check ensuring that `_paybackRatio` does not exceed 1e18. The modified code snippet below demonstrates the necessary safeguard:

```solidity
function acceptWithdrawRequest(
    uint256 providedAmount,
    uint256[] memory _acceptedRequestIds,
    uint256 _paybackRatio
) external onlyRole(BALANCER_ROLE) whenNotPaused {
    IERC20(collateralTokenAddress).safeTransferFrom(
        msg.sender,
        address(this),
        providedAmount
    );
    require(
        _paybackRatio >= minimumPaybackRatio,
        "SolverVault: Payback ratio is too low"
    );
    require(
        _paybackRatio <= 1e18,
        "SolverVault: Payback ratio is too high"
    );
}
```

This modification ensures that `_paybackRatio` remains within the valid range, mitigating potential financial risks.
