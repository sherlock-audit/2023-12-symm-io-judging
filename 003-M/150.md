# depositToSymmio() might cause reverts in USDT vaults

## Summary
If vault collateral is USDT, depositToSymmio() might not function
## Vulnerability Detail
USDT requires setting the approval to 0 before setting it to any other value. Since lack of code to reset approval to 0, depositToSymmio() might just revert when calling approve.
## Impact
Vaults will be unable to deposit their collateral to symmio (DOS).

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider add approve(0) before require check

```solidity
         IERC20(collateralTokenAddress).approve(address(symmio), 0);
        require(
            IERC20(collateralTokenAddress).approve(address(symmio), amount),
            "SolverVault: Approve failed"
        );
```
