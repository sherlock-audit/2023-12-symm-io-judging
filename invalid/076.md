# Missing Access Control Checks

## Summary
Missing Access Control Checks
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-symm-io/blob/main/solver-vaults/contracts/SolverVaults.sol#L236

## Vulnerability Detail
The acceptWithdrawRequest function lacks access control checks. Any address can call this function, which may lead to unauthorized withdrawals or manipulation of the withdrawal process.

Risk: If the `onlyRole` modifier is not correctly implemented, or if there's a misconfiguration in role assignments, it may lead to a situation where unauthorized parties could execute the `acceptWithdrawRequest` function.

1. Role Restriction:

The function is marked with the modifier `onlyRole(BALANCER_ROLE)`, which means only addresses with the `BALANCER_ROLE` are allowed to execute this function.
This is a form of access control to ensure that only authorized parties, typically balancers, can call this function.

2. Missing Role Checks:

The modifier `onlyRole(BALANCER_ROLE)` is used to check if the caller has the `BALANCER_ROLE`. However, this modifier is defined externally and is not part of the code.
It's important to note that the effectiveness of the access control relies on the proper implementation of the `onlyRole` modifier.

## Code Snippet
  
    function acceptWithdrawRequest(
        uint256 providedAmount,
        uint256[] memory _acceptedRequestIds,
        uint256 _paybackRatio
    ) external onlyRole(BALANCER_ROLE) whenNotPaused {
        IERC20(collateralTokenAddress).safeTransferFrom(
            msg.sender,
            address(this),
            providedAmount
        );
        require(
            _paybackRatio >= minimumPaybackRatio,
            "SolverVault: Payback ratio is too low"
        );
        uint256 totalRequiredBalance = lockedBalance;

        for (uint256 i = 0; i < _acceptedRequestIds.length; i++) {
            uint256 id = _acceptedRequestIds[i];
            require(
                id < withdrawRequests.length,
                "SolverVault: Invalid request ID"
            );
            require(
                withdrawRequests[id].status == RequestStatus.Pending,
                "SolverVault: Invalid accepted request"
            );
            totalRequiredBalance +=
                (withdrawRequests[id].amount * _paybackRatio) /
                1e18;
            withdrawRequests[id].status = RequestStatus.Ready;
            withdrawRequests[id].acceptedRatio = _paybackRatio;
        }

        require(
            IERC20(collateralTokenAddress).balanceOf(address(this)) >=
                totalRequiredBalance,
            "SolverVault: Insufficient contract balance"
        );
        lockedBalance = totalRequiredBalance;
        emit WithdrawRequestAcceptedEvent(
            providedAmount,
            _acceptedRequestIds,
            _paybackRatio
        );
    } 

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add access control checks to restrict the execution of `acceptWithdrawRequest` to authorized roles.
Ensure that the onlyRole modifier is correctly implemented and roles are assigned appropriately during contract initialization or through other mechanisms.
Double-check the assignment of the `BALANCER_ROLE` to ensure that only trusted addresses are granted this role.
The code below is an example of how you might implement the `onlyRole` modifier

## Code Snippet

      modifier onlyRole(bytes32 role) {
         require(hasRole(role, msg.sender), "SolverVault: Sender must have the required role");
          _;
      }
