# All withdrawal request claim can be front-run before pause is initiated

## Summary

`PAUSER_ROLE` has ability to pause the system and restricting money flow (deposits and withdrawal request claims), however all pending withdrawal request can front-run and withdraw once pause transaction is detected.

## Vulnerability Detail

```solidity
    function claimForWithdrawRequest(uint256 requestId) external whenNotPaused {
```

- function only takes requestId as input, and doesn't have that caller should be receiver or initiator.
- function can be call when pause is not active

So once pause is detected, anyone (and certainly, respective receivers of their request) can trigger `claimForWithdrawRequest` to get the money out of the system before its paused.

## Impact

In case of any misshaping, losses might be among remaining uses while some users will be able to front-run and get their money out of the system.

## Recommendation

- keep claims for existing request not pausable
- Implement epoch based claims such that certain time needs to passed between accepting of request and claiming
