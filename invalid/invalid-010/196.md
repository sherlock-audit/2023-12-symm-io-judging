## Code Snippet

```javascript
   for (uint256 i = 0; i < _acceptedRequestIds.length; i++) {
            uint256 id = _acceptedRequestIds[i];
            require(
                id < withdrawRequests.length,
                "SolverVault: Invalid request ID"
            );
            require(
                withdrawRequests[id].status == RequestStatus.Pending,
                "SolverVault: Invalid accepted request"
            );
            totalRequiredBalance +=
                (withdrawRequests[id].amount * _paybackRatio) /
                1e18;
            withdrawRequests[id].status = RequestStatus.Ready;
            withdrawRequests[id].acceptedRatio = _paybackRatio;
        }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
`SolverVault :: acceptWithdrawRequest` should process Withdraw Request per user not use an array to do all `WithdrawRequest`.
You can also add  a mapping to an index  of the array to track the WithdrawRequest index.
