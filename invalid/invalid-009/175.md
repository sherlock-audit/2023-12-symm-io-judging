# Uninitialized Implementation Contracts Vulnerability

## Summary

The implementation contracts in the smart contract exhibit a vulnerability where they are left uninitialized, posing a potential security risk. It's important to note that no proxy contract was identified in the codebase, so this finding assumes the risk of a bad contract initialization, which cannot be directly verified. To counteract this vulnerability, it is advised to include a call to _disableInitializers within the constructor to prevent unauthorized initialization by malicious entities.

## Vulnerability Detail

The vulnerability lies in the absence of proper initialization for the implementation contracts, leaving them susceptible to potential exploitation.

## Impact

In the event of unauthorized initialization by an attacker, there is a risk of compromising the proxy, which could lead to various security implications.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

To mitigate the identified vulnerability, it is strongly recommended to modify the implementation contract's constructor to include a call to _disableInitializers. This ensures that unauthorized initialization attempts are thwarted, reducing the risk of security compromises.
