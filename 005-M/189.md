# Users will lose funds due to amountInCollateral being truncated

## Summary

Symm's deposit collateralToken for solverVaultTokens is calculated with two cases

```Solidity 
solverVaultTokenDecimals >= collateralTokenDecimals
            ? amount * (10 ** (solverVaultTokenDecimals - collateralTokenDecimals))
            : amount / (10 ** (collateralTokenDecimals - solverVaultTokenDecimals));
```
In the event that the[ solverVaultTokenDecimals < collateralTokenDecimals](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-symm-io/blob/main/solver-vaults/contracts/SolverVaults.sol#L216-L217) the users amountInSolverVaultTokenDecimals would be truncated down to the solverVaultTokenDecimals leaving everything else as lost funds for the user
 
## Vulnerability Detail
In the event that solverVaultTokenDecimals < collateralTokenDecimals the user value would be truncated, consider the following example:
collateralTokenDecimals = 18
solverVaultTokenDecimals = 6
`10000000999999999999/ (10 ^ (18-6)) = 10000000`
the user would 10000000 solverVaultTokens which when the user goes to withdraw will be calculated as the following:

`amount * (10 ** (collateralTokenDecimals - solverVaultTokenDecimals` or for our example:
`10000000 * (10 ** (18-6)) = 10000000000000000000` 

leaving the user with a loss of 999999999999 wei this can happen on all deposits that have wei on the magnitude of 1e(collateralTokenDecimals - solverVaultTokenDecimals)

This could also create a discrepancy between solverVaultTokens and collateralTokens since there can start being more collateralTokens in comparison to solverVaultTokens which are unaccounted for and have no way for being withdrawn from the contract

## Impact
Users will lose funds due to amountInCollateral being truncated
## Code Snippet
```Solidity
deposit
uint256 amountInSolverVaultTokenDecimals = solverVaultTokenDecimals >= collateralTokenDecimals
    ? amount * (10 ** (solverVaultTokenDecimals - collateralTokenDecimals))
    : amount / (10 ** (collateralTokenDecimals - solverVaultTokenDecimals));
```

```Solidity
requestWithdraw
uint256 amountInCollateralDecimals = collateralTokenDecimals >= solverVaultTokenDecimals
    ? amount * (10 ** (collateralTokenDecimals - solverVaultTokenDecimals))
    : amount / (10 ** (solverVaultTokenDecimals - collateralTokenDecimals));
```

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider getting a value of the deposited amount and converting that into solverVaultToken instead of truncating the token amount
