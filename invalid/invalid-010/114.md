# Unrestricted Zero-Value Withdrawals Exploitable for Low-Cost Denial of Service (DOS)

## Summary

The smart contract displays a critical vulnerability, allowing withdrawal requests with no minimum amount requirement. Notably, this flaw permits zero-value withdrawal requests without any prerequisite deposit. Exploiting this vulnerability could lead to a Denial of Service (DOS) attack on the withdrawal functionality at a remarkably low cost.

Affected code:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-symm-io/blob/main/solver-vaults/contracts/SolverVaults.sol#L252-L267

## Vulnerability Detail

The issue arises in the absence of a minimum amount constraint for withdrawal requests, enabling attackers to exploit the system without incurring any cost. The acceptWithdrawRequest() function's for loop is susceptible to a revert condition if the size of _acceptedRequestIds becomes excessively large, potentially causing an out-of-gas exception.

Of course this implies the balancer's logic is to aim to for covering as many withdrawal as possible when calling acceptWithdrawRequest(). Please note there is no function to remove those withdrawal requests from the withdrawRequests[] mapping or any other function than acceptWithdrawRequest() to change their state.

## Impact

The vulnerability poses a significant risk as it opens the door to a DOS attack, impacting both the withdrawal process for legitimate users and the overall system stability.


## Code Snippet
```solidity

    function test_spam_withdraw() external {
        address spammer = vm.addr(200);

        vm.startPrank(spammer);
        uint256 empty_withdraw = 0 * (10 ** 18);

        for (uint256 i = 0; i < 10000; i++) {
            vault.requestWithdraw(empty_withdraw, spammer);
        }

        vm.stopPrank();
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review + Foundry for the poc

## Recommendation



To mitigate this vulnerability, it is strongly advised to implement a minimum amount requirement for withdrawal requests. This measure will prevent attackers from executing a low-cost DOS attack and safeguard the withdrawal functionality for legitimate users.
