# Missing zero address validation for `receiver`

## Summary
A `WithdrawRequest` with a zero address receiver may lock the collateral token in the contract `SolverVault` forever.
## Vulnerability Detail
The function `requestWithdraw` does not check if `receiver` is a zero address. If a legitimate user submits a withdraw request with a zero address receiver unintentionally, the user needs to burn the SolverVaultToken and the request can not be recalled, thus the user loses the corresponding collateral tokens forever.
## Impact
The user loses the corresponding collateral tokens forever.

## Recommendation
Add a zero address check for `receiver`
```solidity
require(receiver != address(0), "SolverVault: Zero address");
```
