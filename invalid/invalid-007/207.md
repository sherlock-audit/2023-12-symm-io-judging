# `SolverVaults.sol` - L90: Value of `_minimumPaybackRatio` and `minimumPaybackRatio` can only be 0 or 1. If 0, and if `_paybackRatio` from `acceptWithdrawRequest()` is 0 too, then users cannot withdraw.

## Summary

`SolverVaults::initialize()` - L90: Value of `_minimumPaybackRatio` and `minimumPaybackRatio` can only be 0 or 1. If 0, and if `_paybackRatio` from `acceptWithdrawRequest()` is 0 too, then `(withdrawRequests[id].amount * _paybackRatio) / 1e18` on L263 will be 0.

When passing 0 as the value for the minimum payback ratio during contract initialization, which is allowed by the current implementation, it would be possible to pass 0 for same value during the `acceptWithdrawRequest()` function call, either accidentally or intentionally, which seems to result in users not being able to withdraw their requested amounts at all. This does not seem to be intended functionality.

## Vulnerability Detail

There's only one of two possibilities here, and the documentation isnt clear on the intention in terms of this:

So, either the intention was:
- to make the value of `minimumPaybackRatio` be any rational number <= 1.
  -- because in terms of integers, only 1 and 0 are possible here, and 0 doesn't really make sense to me.
OR
- make the value of `minimumPaybackRatio` be any integer number >= 1.

(The default value of any uint variable/parameter in solidity is 0. So either 0 will be passed intentionally by rogue trusted user, or accidentally passed. Result is the same, zero value.)

Regardless, the consequence is that 0 value can be passed for `_minimumPaybackRatio` in `initialize()` which assigns it to `minimumPaybackRatio`, and then in function `acceptWithdrawRequest()` the `_paybackRatio` parameter could be 0 too, and still be a valid value, causing the `(withdrawRequests[id].amount * _paybackRatio) / 1e18` to evaluate to zero too in below function, which means `totalRequiredBalance` won't get incremented with non-zero `withdrawRequests[id].amount * _paybackRatio` amounts for each withdrawal request id, most likely resulting in the users not being able to withdraw any funds, which doesn't seem to be an intended functionality.

## Impact

- Medium severity because the trusted user needs to accidentally pass 0 or intentionally pass 0 if gone rogue...

## Code Snippet

```solidity
    function acceptWithdrawRequest(
        uint256 providedAmount,
        uint256[] memory _acceptedRequestIds,
        uint256 _paybackRatio
    ) external onlyRole(BALANCER_ROLE) whenNotPaused {
        IERC20(collateralTokenAddress).safeTransferFrom(
            msg.sender,
            address(this),
            providedAmount
        );
        require(
            _paybackRatio >= minimumPaybackRatio,
            "SolverVault: Payback ratio is too low"
        ); 
        uint256 totalRequiredBalance = lockedBalance;

        for (uint256 i = 0; i < _acceptedRequestIds.length; i++) {
            uint256 id = _acceptedRequestIds[i];
            require(
                id < withdrawRequests.length,
                "SolverVault: Invalid request ID"
            );
            require(
                withdrawRequests[id].status == RequestStatus.Pending,
                "SolverVault: Invalid accepted request"
            );
            totalRequiredBalance +=
                (withdrawRequests[id].amount * _paybackRatio) /
                1e18; 
            withdrawRequests[id].status = RequestStatus.Ready;
            withdrawRequests[id].acceptedRatio = _paybackRatio;
        }
```

## Recommendation

Unless specifically intended by the protocol, don't allow for zero values for the `minimumPaybackRatio`.
