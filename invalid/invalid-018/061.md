# SolverVaults.sol#requestWithdraw() - user tokens get stuck if the ``receiver`` is blocklisted

## Summary
The ``requestWithdraw()`` function queues up a withdrawal request for the user's collateral in exchange for the SVT token. The user supplied ``receiver`` address could be on the collateral blocklist, leading to the caller losing his SVT tokens.

## Vulnerability Detail
The collateral stablecoins meant to be used by the protocol (USDC and USDT) possess a blocklist/blacklist mechanism that disallow transfer from and to addresses in these lists. The ``requestWithdraw()`` burns the caller SVT tokens in exchange for queueing a withdrawal request for the collateral to the passed ``receiver`` address, meaning that in the scenario that the ``receiver`` turns out to be blacklisted, gets blacklisted before the request or during the request processing (events out of the caller's control) then the user would not be able to retrieve his collateral but his SVT would already be burned, meaning the tokens are now stuck in the vault (since the token transfer itself happens when the request gets accepted).
These tokens cannot be used by ``depositToSymmio()`` either since it takes only a % of the token balance, leaving the other funds stuck in the contract

## Impact
Stuck user funds

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Either check if the receiver is blacklisted in the ``requestWithdraw()`` and revert if it is, or do not burn the SVT until the transaction that attempts the collateral transfer, since it would revert on it's own and the user wouldn't burn his SVT.
