# In the case when `solver` is not set using , the amount deposited by calling `depositToSymmio` goes to 0 address and is permanently locked.

## Summary

The amount deposited by calling `depositToSymmio` goes might get sent to address(0) and stay permanently locked if solver is not set to a legit address

## Vulnerability Detail

If the `setSolver` is not called by the  `SETTER_ROLE` the funds passed to the `depositToSymmio` will be lost as the function does not verify if the solver was set.

```solidity
function depositToSymmio(
        uint256 amount
    ) external onlyRole(DEPOSITOR_ROLE) whenNotPaused {
        uint256 contractBalance = IERC20(collateralTokenAddress).balanceOf(
            address(this)
        );
        require(
            contractBalance - lockedBalance >= amount,
            "SolverVault: Insufficient contract balance"
        );
        require(
            IERC20(collateralTokenAddress).approve(address(symmio), amount),
            "SolverVault: Approve failed"
        );
        symmio.depositFor(solver, amount);
        emit DepositToSymmio(msg.sender, solver, amount);
    }
```

## Impact

The funds are lost when that is clearly not the intention

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Check if the solver is set to a correct address, and not to address(0)
