# Allowance was not set to zero first before changing the allowance

## Summary

Allowance was not set to zero first before changing the allowance

## Vulnerability Detail

As mentioned in Context Q&A,

> Which ERC20 tokens do you expect will interact with the smart contracts?

USDT, USDC

Certain ERC20 tokens, such as USDT, have limitations when it comes to modifying the allowance from a non-zero value. For instance, the approve() function of Tether (USDT) will throw an error if the current approval is not set to zero. This safeguard is in place to prevent unauthorized alterations of approvals and mitigate the risk of front-running attacks.

In `SolverVaults.sol`, depositToSymmio function there is approval ERC20 

```solidity
        require(
            IERC20(collateralTokenAddress).approve(address(symmio), amount),
            "SolverVault: Approve failed"
        );
```

since USDT is known to have this issue, it's better to approve 0 amount first.

## Impact

Failed to approve the token, will resulting in failed transfer of the token, which is not expected by the protocol.
