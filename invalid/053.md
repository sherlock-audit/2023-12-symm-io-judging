# `SolverVault :: claimForWithdrawRequest` user can lose all funds if they don't have `requestId`

## Summary
A user can lose all their  funds if they don't have their  `requestId` to Withdraw funds

## Vulnerability Detail
The `requestId` is a position of the array it has nothing to do with the user outside of the contract and it is independent of a user address

## Impact
 if the user dose not know `requestId` they can't Withdraw their funds.

## Code Snippet
```javascript 
   @>  function claimForWithdrawRequest(uint256 requestId) external whenNotPaused {
        require(
            requestId < withdrawRequests.length,
            "SolverVault: Invalid request ID"
        );
   @>       WithdrawRequest storage request = withdrawRequests[requestId];

```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
 1. have a state variable for mapping an address to a `requestId`  that is set in the `requestWithdraw` function
 2. `claimForWithdrawRequest` function should not take any parameter
 3. msg.sender should be to get the ` requestId` and then pass it to the `withdrawRequests` array to get a storage element
 
```diff
-        function claimForWithdrawRequest(uint256 requestId) external whenNotPaused {
        require(
            requestId < withdrawRequests.length,
            "SolverVault: Invalid request ID"
        );
-       WithdrawRequest storage request = withdrawRequests[requestId];

        require(
            request.status == RequestStatus.Ready,
            "SolverVault: Request not ready for withdrawal"
        );

        request.status = RequestStatus.Done;
        uint256 amount = (request.amount * request.acceptedRatio) / 1e18;
        lockedBalance -= amount;
        IERC20(collateralTokenAddress).safeTransfer(request.receiver, amount);
        emit WithdrawClaimedEvent(requestId, request.receiver);
    }

+     mapping(address=>uint256) public AddressToWithdrawRequest;

+      function claimForWithdrawRequest() external whenNotPaused {
+       uint256 requestId = AddressToWithdrawRequest[msg.sender];
        require(
            requestId < withdrawRequests.length,
            "SolverVault: Invalid request ID"
        );
        WithdrawRequest storage request = withdrawRequests[requestId];

        require(
            request.status == RequestStatus.Ready,
            "SolverVault: Request not ready for withdrawal"
        );

        request.status = RequestStatus.Done;
        uint256 amount = (request.amount * request.acceptedRatio) / 1e18;
        lockedBalance -= amount;
        IERC20(collateralTokenAddress).safeTransfer(request.receiver, amount);
        emit WithdrawClaimedEvent(requestId, request.receiver);
    }
