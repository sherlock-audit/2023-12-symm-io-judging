# Token approval incompatibilities may cause a DoS

## Summary

The token approval to the Symmio contract uses the standard ERC20 interface, which can cause different incompatibilities with some ERC20 implementations.

## Vulnerability Detail

In `depositToSymmio()`, the implementation uses the standard call to `ERC20.approve()` in order to grant the Symmio contract allowance to pull funds when executing the deposit.

There are different incompatibilities in some token implementations that can cause this operation to fail, leading to an accidental denial of service:

1. Some ERC20 implementations don't return a value. This will cause a revert when the implementation tries to decode the `bool` return value of the call to `approve()`.
2. In some implementations, the allowance needs to be reset to 0 before it can be changed again. If the spender doesn't consume the full allowance, then the next call to `approve()` will fail, as the allowance will be greater than 0.

As an example, both of these issues are present in the reference USDT implementation.

## Impact

Deposits to Symmio may be blocked due to a revert in the token approval of `depositToSymmio()`.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Use `SafeERC20.forceApprove()` to handle both the allowance reset to 0 and the optional `bool` return value.
