# Rounding issues with `SolverVault::requestWithdraw()` results in a loss of deposits for the user.

## Summary
A user can withdraw at least the `acceptedRatio` setup and populated by `_paybackRatio` when they request withdrawal of their deposited asset e.g 70% of the amount (USDC or USDT etc) they deposit into the SolverVault. However, the calculation for this amount has a rounding issue which coupled with the token decimals (18) of the `SolverVaultToken` rounds down the amount to be effectively 0 in the case a user withdraws in small batches. 

## Vulnerability Detail
1. User deposits 500 USDC into the SolverVault. Gets minted SolverVaultTokens relative to their deposit plus decimals factored in e.g for a deposit of 500 USDC (500E6), gets minted 5E20 solver vault tokens.
2. User decides to withdraw 50 USDC (50E6). Some of their effective SVT gets burnt, withdrawal amount is calculated as: amount / (10 ** (solverVaultTokenDecimals - collateralTokenDecimals)); = 0.00005 USDC === 0 after rounding saved to their `withdrawRequest` amount. The SVT token decimals will always be 18 as it was never overriden to reflect the collateralToken decimals of 6 or a figure closer to that range e.g 8 as used in the MockERC20 test environment.
3. The balancer accepts this and sets the `acceptedRatio` e.g to 70%
4. The user claims the withdrawal, receives 0 USDC

POC in foundry:
```javascript
function testRequestWithdraw() public {
    uint256 depositAmount = 500e6;
    uint256 withdrawAmountInCollateralDecimals = depositAmount;
    uint256 withdrawAmount = 50e6;

    vm.prank(owner);
    collateralToken.mint(user, depositAmount);
    vm.prank(user);
    collateralToken.approve(address(solverVault), depositAmount);

    // deposits
    vm.prank(user);
    solverVault.deposit(depositAmount);

    console.log("Starting Collateral: ", collateralToken.balanceOf(address(solverVault)));

    vm.prank(user);
    solverVaultToken.approve(address(solverVault), withdrawAmount);

    vm.prank(user);
    solverVault.requestWithdraw(withdrawAmount, receiver);

    (address retReceiver, uint256 amount, SolverVault.RequestStatus status, uint256 acceptedRatio) = solverVault.withdrawRequests(0);

    address returnedAdd = retReceiver;
    uint256 returnedAmount = amount;
    uint256 returnedRatio = acceptedRatio;

    assertEq(returnedAdd, receiver);
    assertEq(returnedRatio, 0);

    uint256 withdrawRequestsLength = 1;
    uint256[] memory requestIds = new uint256[](1);
    requestIds[0] = 0;

    uint256 paybackRatio = 7e17; // 70%

    vm.prank(balancer);
    solverVault.acceptWithdrawRequest(0, requestIds, paybackRatio);

    vm.prank(owner);
    collateralToken.mint(balancer, depositAmount);
    vm.prank(balancer);
    collateralToken.approve(address(solverVault), depositAmount);

    (address retReceiver1, uint256 amount1, SolverVault.RequestStatus status1, uint256 acceptedRatio1) = solverVault.withdrawRequests(0);

    vm.prank(receiver);
    solverVault.claimForWithdrawRequest(0);

    (address retReceiver2, uint256 amount2, SolverVault.RequestStatus status2, uint256 acceptedRatio2) = solverVault.withdrawRequests(0);

    console.log("Ending Collateral: ", collateralToken.balanceOf(receiver));
    assertEq(collateralToken.balanceOf(receiver), 0);
  }

Result:
[PASS] testRequestWithdraw() (gas: 389014)
Logs:
  Starting Collateral:  500000000
  Ending Collateral:  0

Traces:
  [389014] SolverVaultTest::testRequestWithdraw()
```

## Impact
Unless a user specifies the full amount deposited and converts to the SVT equivalent e.g 500E6 ==== 5E20 minted during `deposit` they will be unable to withdraw and will have burnt SVT for no cause. This will result in the user losing their deposited amount.
Note that the protocol used a closely related MockER20 contract in their test suite to closely mimick SVT in production but both token contracts are different and will result in the vulnerability above.

## Code Snippet
Rounding issue in `requestWithdraw`

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-symm-io/blob/main/solver-vaults/contracts/SolverVaults.sol#L212-L228
```javascript
function requestWithdraw(
        uint256 amount,
        address receiver
    ) external whenNotPaused {
        require(
            SolverVaultToken(solverVaultTokenAddress).balanceOf(msg.sender) >=
                amount,
            "SolverVault: Insufficient token balance"
        );
        SolverVaultToken(solverVaultTokenAddress).burnFrom(msg.sender, amount);

        uint256 amountInCollateralDecimals = collateralTokenDecimals >=
            solverVaultTokenDecimals
            ? amount *
                (10 ** (collateralTokenDecimals - solverVaultTokenDecimals)) 
            : amount /
                (10 ** (solverVaultTokenDecimals - collateralTokenDecimals)); // @audit issue with rounding
        // 5e20/1e12 = 500e6
        // 50e6/1e12 = 0.00005
        console.log("Amount in Decimals: ", amountInCollateralDecimals);

        currentDeposit -= amountInCollateralDecimals; // @audit-issue no change in case of roundin issue 

        withdrawRequests.push(
            WithdrawRequest({
                receiver: receiver,
                amount: amountInCollateralDecimals, // @audit-issue 0
                status: RequestStatus.Pending,
                acceptedRatio: 0
            })
        );
        emit WithdrawRequestEvent(
            withdrawRequests.length - 1,
            receiver,
            amountInCollateralDecimals
        );
    }
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Keep the SVT decimals consistent with the `collateralTokenDecimals` just as you did with the MockERC20 e.g 6 decimals by overriding the decimals function exposed by OZ ERC20 or setting a decimal that mimicks the `collateralTokenDecimals` similar to the setup used in testing which removes the need for rounding. or Re-write the `amountInCollateralDecimals` & `amountInSolverVaultTokenDecimals` logic of the `deposit` and `requestWithdraw` functions to rid the rounding issue.
