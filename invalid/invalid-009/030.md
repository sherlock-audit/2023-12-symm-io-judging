# Anyone can front-run the call to `initialize`

## Summary
Anyone can front-run the call to `initialize`

## Vulnerability Detail
Upon deployment, a call to `initialize` is needed to set the essential contract parameters. However, the function lacks access control and anyone can call it.  This would likely immediately be caught but will still require a redeployment + the issue could occur again.

```solidity
    function initialize(
        address _symmioAddress,
        address _symmioVaultTokenAddress,
        address _solver,
        uint256 _minimumPaybackRatio,
        uint256 _depositLimit
    ) public initializer {
        __AccessControl_init();
        __Pausable_init();
        
        require(_minimumPaybackRatio <= 1e18, "SolverVault: Invalid ratio");
        
        _grantRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE, msg.sender);
        _grantRole(DEPOSITOR_ROLE, msg.sender);
        _grantRole(BALANCER_ROLE, msg.sender);
        _grantRole(SETTER_ROLE, msg.sender);
        _grantRole(PAUSER_ROLE, msg.sender);
        _grantRole(UNPAUSER_ROLE, msg.sender);
        setSymmioAddress(_symmioAddress);
        setSymmioVaultTokenAddress(_symmioVaultTokenAddress);
        setDepositLimit(_depositLimit);
        setSolver(_solver);
        lockedBalance = 0;
        currentDeposit = 0;
        minimumPaybackRatio = _minimumPaybackRatio;
    }
```

## Impact
Anyone can take control of the contract upon deployment

## Recommendation
add a constructor which calls the initialize function
