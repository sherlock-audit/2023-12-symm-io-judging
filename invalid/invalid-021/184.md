# Contract Redundancy Review: Simplifying Unnecessary Logic in setSymmioAddress Function

## Summary
The contract sets collateralTokenAddress to the zero address by default and doesn't change it when calling the initial address. In the setSymmioAddress function, there's a redundant logic address beforeCollateral = collateralTokenAddress; that eventually becomes the zero address. The subsequent require statement returns true and isn't used elsewhere in the contract. This logic seems unnecessary.


## Vulnerability Detail
Redundant logic exists in the contract's setSymmioAddress function, involving the assignment of beforeCollateral, which doesn't serve any purpose in the contract's functionality.


## Impact
The redundant logic doesn't directly impact the functionality of the contract but adds unnecessary complexity to the codebase.


## Code Snippet

```solidity
address public collateralTokenAddress;
...
function setSymmioAddress(
        address _symmioAddress
    ) public onlyRole(SETTER_ROLE) {
        require(_symmioAddress != address(0), "SolverVault: Zero address");
        symmio = ISymmio(_symmioAddress);
        address beforeCollateral = collateralTokenAddress;
        updateCollateral();
        require(
            beforeCollateral == collateralTokenAddress ||
                beforeCollateral == address(0),
            "SolverVault: Collateral can not be changed"
        );
        emit SymmioAddressUpdatedEvent(_symmioAddress);
    }
``` 

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider omitting the redundant logic involving beforeCollateral, as it doesn't contribute to the contract's functionality. Simplifying the codebase by removing unnecessary instructions enhances readability and maintenance.
