# Complete DOS of the setSymmioAddress function will happen if called again after the initial call

## Summary
The `setSymmioAddress` function is used to set the address `_symmioAddress`, but when reading through the function, the function will not work if it is called again after the initial call, as the below require statement will never pass
```solidity
 require(
            beforeCollateral == collateralTokenAddress ||
                beforeCollateral == address(0),
            "SolverVault: Collateral can not be changed"
        );
```
## Vulnerability Detail

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-symm-io/blob/main/solver-vaults/contracts/SolverVaults.sol#L107C5-L120C6

The details about how this would occur is as follows, 

After setting the symmio address, the function tries to set the beforeCollateral to the collateralTokenAddress, Then it updates the collateral as seen below 
```solidity
address beforeCollateral = collateralTokenAddress;
//@audit Here We can see that collateralTokenAddress has not been updated at first, 
        updateCollateral();
```
When we check the `updateCollateral` function, we have an insight into how it works 

```solidity
function updateCollateral() internal {
        collateralTokenAddress = symmio.getCollateral();
//@audit Here we can see that the collateral token is just being set here, which is actually dynamic, and can be changed, becuase it is coming from the symmio contract 
        collateralTokenDecimals = IERC20Metadata(collateralTokenAddress)
            .decimals();
        require(
            collateralTokenDecimals <= 18,
            "SolverVault: Collateral decimals should be lower than 18"
        );
    }
```
So when we explore futher the require statement, we see how the vunerabilty builds up 
```solidity
require(
            beforeCollateral == collateralTokenAddress ||
                beforeCollateral == address(0),
            "SolverVault: Collateral can not be changed"
        );
//@audit Here the require statement, will pass as the before collateral will be address(0), 
```
But Because The `updateCollateral` function, is called after setting the address beforeCollateral = collateralTokenAddress;, this means that if the collateralTokenAddress, is being updated as being implied in the function ,

Then 
```solidity
 address beforeCollateral = collateralTokenAddress;
//@audit This will set the `beforeCollateral` to the previous address then the new collateral address will be done below
updateCollateral();
```
```solidity
require(
            beforeCollateral == collateralTokenAddress ||
                beforeCollateral == address(0),
            "SolverVault: Collateral can not be changed"
        );
//@audit Here the require statement, will not pass as the before collateral will not be equal to the new collateral token nor will it be address(0), 
```

## Impact
Complete DOS of the setSymmioAddress after the first initial call

## Recommendation
The Main Recomendation is to call `updateCollateral` before this line of code ` address beforeCollateral = collateralTokenAddress;`
