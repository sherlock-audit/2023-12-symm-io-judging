# The setSymmioVaultTokenAddress function acks a consistency check for the collateral token's decimals

## Summary

The setSymmioVaultTokenAddress function in the SolverVaults.sol contract lacks a consistency check for the collateral token's decimals, similar to the check performed for the solverVaultToken's decimals.

## Vulnerability Detail
The vulnerability lies in the setSymmioVaultTokenAddress function within the SolverVaults.sol contract. While the code correctly checks if the solverVaultToken's decimals are below 18, it lacks a similar check for the collateralToken's decimals. This inconsistency introduces a potential risk, as it may lead to unexpected behavior and miscalculations due to varying decimal precision between the two tokens. Ensuring a consistent check for both tokens' decimals is crucial for maintaining uniformity in the system and mitigating the potential for inaccuracies in calculations and representations during interactions with different tokens. Addressing this vulnerability will enhance the overall robustness and reliability of the smart contract.
## Impact

The absence of a consistent check for the collateral token's decimals in the setSymmioVaultTokenAddress function introduces a potential impact on the system's accuracy and reliability. The impact stems from the risk of misalignment between the two token types, leading to miscalculations and unexpected behaviors during interactions.

Decimals play a crucial role in token conversions and mathematical operations. Without a uniform check for both solverVaultToken and collateralToken decimals, the system may misinterpret values, resulting in discrepancies in calculations. This inconsistency could affect various functionalities such as deposit and withdrawal processes, potentially leading to inaccurate representations of token balances and values.

Furthermore, the lack of a consistent check may introduce complexity when managing different tokens, increasing the likelihood of errors in the handling of decimal precision. This could impact user experience, hinder proper risk management, and potentially expose vulnerabilities in the system's financial logic.

In summary, the impact of not having a consistent check for the collateral token's decimals is a heightened risk of calculation inaccuracies and unexpected behavior during token interactions, which could compromise the reliability and integrity of the smart contract system.

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-symm-io/blob/main/solver-vaults/contracts/SolverVaults.sol#L138-L149
```solidity
// Inside setSymmioVaultTokenAddress function
function setSymmioVaultTokenAddress(address _symmioVaultTokenAddress) internal {
    require(_symmioVaultTokenAddress != address(0), "SolverVault: Zero address");
    solverVaultTokenAddress = _symmioVaultTokenAddress;
    solverVaultTokenDecimals = SolverVaultToken(_symmioVaultTokenAddress).decimals();
    require(
        solverVaultTokenDecimals <= 18,
        "SolverVault: SolverVaultToken decimals should be lower than 18"
    );

    // Missing check for collateralToken's decimals
    // Add a similar check for collateralToken's decimals here
}
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

It is recommended to enhance the setSymmioVaultTokenAddress function by adding a consistent check for the collateralToken's decimals, similar to the check performed for the solverVaultToken's decimals. This will ensure uniformity and reduce the risk of unintended issues related to decimals when interacting with different tokens.

```solidity
// Inside setSymmioVaultTokenAddress function
function setSymmioVaultTokenAddress(address _symmioVaultTokenAddress) internal {
    require(_symmioVaultTokenAddress != address(0), "SolverVault: Zero address");
    solverVaultTokenAddress = _symmioVaultTokenAddress;
    solverVaultTokenDecimals = SolverVaultToken(_symmioVaultTokenAddress).decimals();
    require(
        solverVaultTokenDecimals <= 18,
        "SolverVault: SolverVaultToken decimals should be lower than 18"
    );

    // Additional check for collateralToken's decimals
    address collateralToken = symmio.getCollateral();
    uint256 collateralTokenDecimals = IERC20Metadata(collateralToken).decimals();
    require(
        collateralTokenDecimals <= 18,
        "SolverVault: CollateralToken decimals should be lower than 18"
    );
}
