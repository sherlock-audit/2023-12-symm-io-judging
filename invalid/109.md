# Context sender missmatch

## Summary

Inherited contracts fail to use the recommended context sender and might cause problems for relayers.

## Vulnerability Detail

Contracts `SolverVault` and `SolverVaultToken` inherit from contracts that use a functionality of the `ContextUpgradeable` / `Context` contracts of OpenZeppelin, e.g.:
```solidity
contract SolverVault is
    Initializable,
    AccessControlEnumerableUpgradeable,
    PausableUpgradeable
```
```solidity
abstract contract AccessControlEnumerableUpgradeable is Initializable, IAccessControlEnumerable, AccessControlUpgradeable
```
```solidity
abstract contract AccessControlUpgradeable is Initializable, ContextUpgradeable, IAccessControl, ERC165Upgradeable
```

Context is designed to be used with Ethereum Gas Station Network (GSN), thus it encourages to use `_msgSender()` instead of `msg.sender`:
```solidity
 * @dev Provides information about the current execution context, including the
 * sender of the transaction and its data. While these are generally available
 * via msg.sender and msg.data, they should not be accessed in such a direct
 * manner, since when dealing with meta-transactions the account sending and
 * paying for execution may not be the actual sender (as far as an application
 * is concerned).
```

When `AccessControlUpgradeable` checks the user role, it uses `_msgSender()`:
```solidity
    /**
     * @dev Reverts with an {AccessControlUnauthorizedAccount} error if `_msgSender()`
     * is missing `role`. Overriding this function changes the behavior of the {onlyRole} modifier.
     */
    function _checkRole(bytes32 role) internal view virtual {
        _checkRole(role, _msgSender());
    }
```

However, your contracts always directly use `msg.sender`. For instance, when depositing to Vault:
```solidity
IERC20(collateralTokenAddress).safeTransferFrom(
    msg.sender,
    address(this),
    amount
);
```

When accepting requests it validates that `_msgSender()` has the `BALANCER_ROLE` but transfers tokens from `msg.sender`:
```solidity
function acceptWithdrawRequest(
    uint256 providedAmount,
    uint256[] memory _acceptedRequestIds,
    uint256 _paybackRatio
) external onlyRole(BALANCER_ROLE) whenNotPaused {
    IERC20(collateralTokenAddress).safeTransferFrom(
        msg.sender,
        address(this),
        providedAmount
    );
```

If the `msg.sender` and  `_msgSender()` are different, it will validate the role of the user but transfer the tokens from the relayer.

## Impact

If the GSN relayer functionality provided by the inherited Context contracts is utilized, the contracts will deduct funds from the wrong users.
