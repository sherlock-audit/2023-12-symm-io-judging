# SolverVault::requestWithdraw When submitting a 'Withdraw Request,' the user is left with neither the vault token nor the withdrawn amount.

## Summary
The ``acceptWithdrawRequest`` function in the ``SolverVaults`` contract burns vault tokens immediately upon user withdrawal requests. for the time being User Do not have any token.

## Vulnerability Detail

when users request a withdrawal. Their vault tokens are burned immediately, but if the ``acceptWithdrawRequest`` function fails due to any potential reason, the withdrawal requests of the users could be reverted. However, the users have already had their vault tokens burned in the ``requestWithdraw`` function, leaving them without the vault tokens nor the withdrawn amount.

## Impact

Users could potentially lose their vault tokens without receiving the corresponding withdrawal amount

Manual Review




## Recommendation
```js
function acceptWithdrawRequest(
    uint256 providedAmount,
    uint256[] memory _acceptedRequestIds,
    uint256 _paybackRatio
) external onlyRole(BALANCER_ROLE) whenNotPaused {
    /* Code omitted for brevity */
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < _acceptedRequestIds.length; i++) {
        /* Code omitted for brevity */
        SolverVaultToken(solverVaultTokenAddress).burnFrom(withdrawRequests[id].receiver, withdrawRequests[id].amount);
        /* Remaining code omitted for brevity */
    }
    /* Remaining code omitted for brevity */
}
```
a possible solution would be to burn the vault tokens only after the withdrawal request is successfully accepted and not at the time of request. This way, if there's a failure in accepting the withdrawal due to insufficient contract balance, the users will still have their vault tokens.
