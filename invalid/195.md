# Inaccurate check for `_paybackRatio`

## Summary
A payback ratio that is greater than 1 may bring token loss for the current contract `SolverVaults`.
## Vulnerability Detail
The function `acceptWithdrawRequest` checks if `_paybackRatio` is not smaller than `minimumPaybackRatio`. 
```solidity
        require(
            _paybackRatio >= minimumPaybackRatio,
            "SolverVault: Payback ratio is too low"
        );
```
However, according to the sponsor's comments from Discord.
> Users have the option to request the withdrawal of their funds and are guaranteed to receive at least the 'minimumPaybackRatio' of their investment. Therefore, the 'acceptedRatio' value ranges between this minimum ratio and 1.

The function does not check if `_paybackRatio` is smaller than 1, which may bring tokens loss for the current contract.
## Impact
If `_paybackRatio` is greater than 1e18, the user may get more collateral tokens than he deposited, thus bringing tokens loss for the current contract.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
check if `_paybackRatio` is not over 1e18.
```solidity
        require(
            _paybackRatio >= minimumPaybackRatio && _paybackRatio <= 1e18,
            "SolverVault: Payback ratio is illegal"
        );
```
