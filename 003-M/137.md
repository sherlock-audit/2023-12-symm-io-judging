# collateral tokens(USDT) used in contract must approve by zero first

## Summary
collateral tokens(USDT) used in contract must approve by zero first.

## Vulnerability Detail
Some ERC20 tokens (like USDT) do not work when changing the allowance from an existing non-zero allowance value. For example Tether (USDT)'s approve() function will revert if the current approval is not zero, to protect against front-running changes of approvals.

From contest readme, it is explicitely mentioned that USDT tokens will be used in protocol. USDT(collateral token) is called to approve [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-symm-io/blob/60ee22a4c598220821385cfb5eee43f40aafd5f1/solver-vaults/contracts/SolverVaults.sol#L194), however, this would revert as USDT would be required to approve with 0 value first.

## Impact
The protocol will impossible to use with collateral token like USDT in this protocol.

Approve 0 first in case of USDT or use openzeppelin safeERC20 safeApprove or forceApprove(in new version)
