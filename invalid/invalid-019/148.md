# Precision Loss in `totalRequiredBalance` Calculation

## Summary
The variable `totalRequiredBalance` is calculated as `(withdrawRequests[id].amount * _paybackRatio) / 1e18;`, and it leads to precision loss when dealing with USDC due to its 1e6 precision.

## Vulnerability Detail
When someone withdraws an amount in USDC, a significant difference in the amount occurs because the function's precision is set at 1e18, while USDC operates on a precision of 1e6.

## Impact
The protocol is susceptible to a significant loss of funds due to precision discrepancies.

## Code Snippet
The vulnerable code can be found [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-symm-io/blob/60ee22a4c598220821385cfb5eee43f40aafd5f1/solver-vaults/contracts/SolverVaults.sol#L236-L267).

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
It is recommended to implement dynamic precision handling for different tokens to address this vulnerability.
