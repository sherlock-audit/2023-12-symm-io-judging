# Certain ERC20 token does not return bool from approve which causes `depositToSymmio` revert

## Summary

Certain ERC20 token does not return bool from approve which causes `depositToSymmio` revert

## Vulnerability Detail

In function `depositToSymmio`, the collateralToken will be approved to symmio. However, certain ERC20 token does not return bool from approve (such as USDT), causing `depositToSymmio` revert.

```solidity
require(
            IERC20(collateralTokenAddress).approve(address(symmio), amount),
            "SolverVault: Approve failed"
        );
```
