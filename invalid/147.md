# Allows the user to reset the receiver of WithdrawRequest

## Summary
The user may have set a wrong address or set the receiver address to a blacklist, which will cause the user's funds to be permanently locked and cannot be withdrawn.
## Vulnerability Detail
Users may mishandle addresses when interacting with contracts.Obviously, both USDT and USDC have blacklist mechanisms. Although their implementations are different, they both prohibit blacklist addresses from performing transfer or transferfrom operations.

```solidity
mapping(uint256 requestID => address owner) private requestIDowner;


    function requestWithdraw(
        uint256 amount,
        address receiver
    ) external whenNotPaused {
...
requestIDowner[ withdrawRequests.length - 1] =msg.sender;
emit WithdrawRequestEvent(
            withdrawRequests.length - 1,
            receiver,
            amountInCollateralDecimals
        );
}

    function setReceiver(uint256 _id, address _receiver){
        require(requestIDowner[_id] == msg.sender);
        WithdrawRequest storage request = withdrawRequests[requestId];
        request.receiver  = _receiver;
}
