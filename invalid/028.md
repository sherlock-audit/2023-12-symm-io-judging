# Variables should be cached to save gas

## Summary

There are several instances where caching variables would lead to gas savings as well as improved code readability.

Caching variables lead to gas savings and improves code readability.

## Vulnerability Detail

**i. Caching array values:**

`withdrawRequests[id]` is called four times for each iteration in the for-loop - caching it means saving plenty of MLOAD (which saves gas).

**ii. Caching variable only used once:**

Since we should now be caching `withdrawRequests[id]` we can remove the `id` variable declaration and instead make it a one-liner to skip having an additional MLOAD.

**iii. For-loop array:**

Reading the array length at each iteration of the loop costs 6 gas (3 for mload and 3 to place memory_offset) in the stack.

Caching the array length `_acceptedRequestIds.length` outside of the for-loop thus saves 3 gas **per** iteration.

## Impact

Saves gas for its users which is highly desirable.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

The following code:

``` solidity
for (uint256 i = 0; i < _acceptedRequestIds.length; i++) {
            uint256 id = _acceptedRequestIds[i];
            require(
                id < withdrawRequests.length,
                "SolverVault: Invalid request ID"
            );
            require(
                withdrawRequests[id].status == RequestStatus.Pending,
                "SolverVault: Invalid accepted request"
            );
            totalRequiredBalance +=
                (withdrawRequests[id].amount * _paybackRatio) / 1e18;
            withdrawRequests[id].status = RequestStatus.Ready;
            withdrawRequests[id].acceptedRatio = _paybackRatio;
        }

```


Should be updated to the below:

``` solidity
uint256 acceptedRequestIdsLength = _acceptedRequestIds.length;
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < acceptedRequestIdsLength; i++) {
            uint256 withdrawRequestId = withdrawRequests[_acceptedRequestIds[i]];
            require(
                id < withdrawRequests.length,
                "SolverVault: Invalid request ID"
            );
            require(
                acceptedRequestid.status == RequestStatus.Pending,
                "SolverVault: Invalid accepted request"
            );
            totalRequiredBalance +=
                (acceptedRequestid.amount * _paybackRatio) / 1e18;
            acceptedRequestid.status = RequestStatus.Ready;
            acceptedRequestid.acceptedRatio = _paybackRatio;
        }
```
