# `SolverVault.initialize()` can be front-run and prevent the intended contract upgrades due to insufficient access control

## Summary
`SolverVault` is an upgradable contract that uses the `initialize()` method to set vault configurations such as the `_symmioVaultTokenAddress`, the `_symmioAddress` and also gives the `msg.sender` multiple admin roles on the vault (such as `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`, `PAUSER_ROLE`, etc).

After the initial proxy contract is deployed a malicious actor can monitor the mempool for when the `SolverVault` proxy contract makes an external call to `initialize()` a new implementation. The attacker can front-run these calls and configure the `SolverVault` with any values they want.

## Vulnerability Detail
Lack of access control on the `initialize()` can allow malicious actors to front-run the implementation contracts initialization and set any values they want.

## Impact
 An attacker can:

- Set `_symmioVaultTokenAddress` to any address they want.
- Set `_symmioAddress` to any address they want.
- Gain all admin roles on the contract.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
1 - Use openzeppelins upgradable hardhat plugin to manage deploying proxy contracts. There are some security protections for front-runs to the initialization of implementation contracts: https://docs.openzeppelin.com/upgrades-plugins/1.x/

2 - Add a constructor to the `SolverVault` contract  where an admin address is set (for example the proxy contract address or a relayer owned by the protocol team) and only allow that address to call `initialize()`. Here is an example of what that could look like:

```solidity

    constructor (address _vaultAdmin) initializer {
        vaultAdmin = _vaultAdmin;
    }

    function initialize(
        address _symmioAddress,
        address _symmioVaultTokenAddress,
        address _solver,
        uint256 _minimumPaybackRatio,
        uint256 _depositLimit
    ) public initializer {
        __AccessControl_init();
        __Pausable_init();
        
        require(_minimumPaybackRatio <= 1e18, "SolverVault: Invalid ratio");
        require(vaultAdmin == msg.sender, "Only vault admin can initialize the vault");
        
        _grantRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE, msg.sender);
        _grantRole(DEPOSITOR_ROLE, msg.sender);
        _grantRole(BALANCER_ROLE, msg.sender);
        _grantRole(SETTER_ROLE, msg.sender);
        _grantRole(PAUSER_ROLE, msg.sender);
        _grantRole(UNPAUSER_ROLE, msg.sender);
        setSymmioAddress(_symmioAddress);
        setSymmioVaultTokenAddress(_symmioVaultTokenAddress);
        setDepositLimit(_depositLimit);
        setSolver(_solver);
        lockedBalance = 0;
        currentDeposit = 0;
        minimumPaybackRatio = _minimumPaybackRatio;
    }
```
