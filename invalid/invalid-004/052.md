# No way for the user to redeem remainder of the SolverVaultToken withdraw amount.

## Summary

When the user calls requestWithdraw, all of the amount indicated is burned via burnFrom function. There is no way to get the remainder if the amount is not fully approved by the balancer or not approved at all.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the following code, when the function requestWithdraw is called, all the amount of SolverVaultToken of the user is burned. At this point, the withdraw request is not approved.

 It may not be approved ("SolverVault: Payback ratio is too low" or "SolverVault: Insufficient contract balance"), depends on the balancer role which may be a person or a bot according to the team. It may be approved partially due to paybakRatio being low. In both cases no SolverVaultToken is given back to the user.

## Impact
User may get partial amount of its deposit and not compensated with SolverVaultToken. As a result loss of funds for the users in the form of deposited collateral or SolverVaultToken.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Need to rearrange the code so that the burnFrom function is called after the withdraw request has been accepted.
