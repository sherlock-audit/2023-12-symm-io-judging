# `approve` in `depositToSymmio` will revert for USDT

## Summary

USDT has been specified to be a valid collateral token. However, `depositToSymmio` will revert when USDT is the collateral token due to incorrect use of `approve`. 
## Vulnerability Detail

In `depositToSymmIo`, we find the following lines of code:

```solidity
        require(
            IERC20(collateralTokenAddress).approve(address(symmio), amount),
            "SolverVault: Approve failed"
        );
```

However, the vanilla ERC20 approve signature is this:

`function approve(address spender, uint256 value) external returns (bool);`

But for USDT it is this:

`function approve(address spender, uint value) public`

So, this call to approve will revert for USDT even if it should not. This means that `depositToSymmIo` will revert when USDT is the collateral token. 

## Impact

`depositToSymmIo` will revert when USDT is the collateral token, even if it should not
