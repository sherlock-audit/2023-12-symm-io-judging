# DOS of the `acceptWithdrawRequest` function might happen due to miniscule withdrawal amounts and Other Withdrawal activites

## Summary
When users make a withdrawal request, it gets added to an array called `withdrawRequests` where every one is stored, but zero withdrawal amount are not checked, and this structs are also added to the array which adds up to a huge number, which makes the Gas costs to call the function huge to a point that the balancer is not able to accept users withdrawal requests anymore

## Vulnerability Detail
In the requestWithdrawal function as shown below there is no specific check for zero withdrawal amount 

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-symm-io/blob/main/solver-vaults/contracts/SolverVaults.sol#L201C5-L235C1

```solidity
function requestWithdraw(
        uint256 amount,
        address receiver
    ) external whenNotPaused {
        require(
            SolverVaultToken(solverVaultTokenAddress).balanceOf(msg.sender) >=
                amount,
            "SolverVault: Insufficient token balance"
        );
        SolverVaultToken(solverVaultTokenAddress).burnFrom(msg.sender, amount);

        uint256 amountInCollateralDecimals = collateralTokenDecimals >=
            solverVaultTokenDecimals
            ? amount *
                (10 ** (collateralTokenDecimals - solverVaultTokenDecimals))
            : amount /
                (10 ** (solverVaultTokenDecimals - collateralTokenDecimals));

        currentDeposit -= amountInCollateralDecimals;

        withdrawRequests.push(
            WithdrawRequest({
                receiver: receiver,
                amount: amountInCollateralDecimals,
                status: RequestStatus.Pending,
                acceptedRatio: 0
            })
        );
```
This Means that zero amount withdrwals can be made over and over again and gets pushed into the withdrawalRequest array, 

To explore futher we will check the `acceptWithdrawRequest` function to see how it affects the function and causes a DOS 

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-symm-io/blob/main/solver-vaults/contracts/SolverVaults.sol#L236C4-L280C6

```solidity
 function acceptWithdrawRequest(
        uint256 providedAmount,
        uint256[] memory _acceptedRequestIds,
        uint256 _paybackRatio
    ) external onlyRole(BALANCER_ROLE) whenNotPaused {
        IERC20(collateralTokenAddress).safeTransferFrom(
            msg.sender,
            address(this),
            providedAmount
        );
        require(
            _paybackRatio >= minimumPaybackRatio,
            "SolverVault: Payback ratio is too low"
        );
        uint256 totalRequiredBalance = lockedBalance;

        for (uint256 i = 0; i < _acceptedRequestIds.length; i++) {
            uint256 id = _acceptedRequestIds[i];
            require(
                id < withdrawRequests.length,
                "SolverVault: Invalid request ID"
            );
            require(
                withdrawRequests[id].status == RequestStatus.Pending,
                "SolverVault: Invalid accepted request"
            );
            totalRequiredBalance +=
                (withdrawRequests[id].amount * _paybackRatio) /
                1e18;
            withdrawRequests[id].status = RequestStatus.Ready;
            withdrawRequests[id].acceptedRatio = _paybackRatio;
        }
```
In the above code we see that the function uses a ` uint256[] memory _acceptedRequestIds` to loop over request and accept them, but the issue we have being tracking in this report affects this loop as 

- If the Zero Withdrawal requests id are being passed into this function, the Gas costs to loop over those useless requests will be too large that the Balancer will be unable to call the function 

## Impact
DOS of the `acceptWithdrawRequest` function and an inability to execute withdrawals from the vaults

## Code Snippet

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
A Zero Withdrawal amount check should be placed in the `requestWithdraw` function to prevent overloading the array with useless requests. Take a Example as Shown Below 
```solidity
+ require( amount > 0, "Zero amount Withdrawals not allowed")
```
