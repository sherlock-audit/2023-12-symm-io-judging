# Wrong checks will always passes if the collateral is `0x00` address

## Summary
The requires check in `setSymmioAddress` is wrong checks, if there is 0x00 Address set in collateralTokenAddress,  then the requires checkes will always pass .

## Vulnerability Detail

If there is 0x00 Address set in collateralTokenAddress,  then the requires checkes will always pass . The validation of collateralTokenAddress is not enough .

```solidity
   address beforeCollateral = collateralTokenAddress;
        updateCollateral();
        require(
            beforeCollateral == collateralTokenAddress ||
                beforeCollateral == address(0),
            "SolverVault: Collateral can not be changed"
        );
```


## Impact
They are might set wrong collateralTokenAddress .

## Code Snippet

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-symm-io/blob/main/solver-vaults/contracts/SolverVaults.sol#L112C6-L118C11
```solidity
address beforeCollateral = collateralTokenAddress;
        updateCollateral();
        require(
            beforeCollateral == collateralTokenAddress ||
                beforeCollateral == address(0),
            "SolverVault: Collateral can not be changed"
        );
```


## Tool used

Manual Review, VSCode

## Recommendation
Add a new checks forthe updated collateralTokenAddress `afterCollateral` .

```solidity
  function setSymmioAddress(
        address _symmioAddress
    ) public onlyRole(SETTER_ROLE) {
        require(_symmioAddress != address(0), "SolverVault: Zero address");
        symmio = ISymmio(_symmioAddress);

        address beforeCollateral = collateralTokenAddress;
        updateCollateral();
+       address afterCollateral = collateralTokenAddress;
        require(
            beforeCollateral == collateralTokenAddress ||
-          afterCollateral != address(0)
+               (afterCollateral != address(0) && beforeCollateral == address(0)),
            "SolverVault: Collateral can not be changed"
        );
        emit SymmioAddressUpdatedEvent(_symmioAddress);
    }
```
