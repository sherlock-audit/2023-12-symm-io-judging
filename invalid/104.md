# Receiver validation

## Summary

The receiver of the withdrawal request is not validated and anyone can push these tokens to this address with no possibility to undo the request.

## Vulnerability Detail

Users have to specify the `receiver` when requesting a withdrawal. This address is not validated and can have any arbitrary value. When the request is accepted, anyone can call `claimForWithdrawRequest` to forward the tokens to this receiver. In case of a wrong recipient, there is no way to correct that, e.g. edit or cancel the request.

## Impact

User Vault tokens are burned upfront (when requesting) and if the wrong recipient is specified (e.g. empty address), it will be so over, and the collateral tokens will be lost.

## Recommendation

At least a good practice might be to save the request initiator and allow claiming tokens if the recipient does not claim them in a specified timeframe after acceptance, e.g. 2 weeks.
