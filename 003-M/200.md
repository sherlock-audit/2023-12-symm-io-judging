# `depositToSymmio` does not approve to zero first

## Summary
In the `depositToSymmio` function, before calling `symmio.depositFor`, the `SolverVaults` contract needs to approve symmio to make use of an amount of collateral tokens. The issue is that before approving, symmio's allowance is not reset to zero, which could be problematic for some ERC20 tokens that require an address's allowance to be 0, before increasing it.

## Vulnerability Detail
One such token is USDT which will be used as a collateral token. Therefore, when the collateral token is USDT, deposits to symmio may revert if symmio's allowance is more than 0.

## Impact
The `depositToSymmio` function may revert if the collateral token is USDC.

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-symm-io/blob/main/solver-vaults/contracts/SolverVaults.sol#L193C8-L196C11
```solidity
require(
          IERC20(collateralTokenAddress).approve(address(symmio), amount),
          "SolverVault: Approve failed"
      );
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Approve to 0 before approving the actual amount or implement SafeERC20's `safeIncreaseAllowance`.
