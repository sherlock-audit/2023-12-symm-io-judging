# `ERC20Burnable` exposes the `burn()` and `burnFrom()`, which allow anyone to burn `SolverVaultToken`

## Summary
`ERC20Burnable` exposes the `burn()` and `burnFrom()`, which allow anyone to burn `SolverVaultToken`

## Vulnerability Detail
The `ERC20Burnable` interface includes two public functions: `burn()` and `burnFrom()`. These functions enable any user to burn their `SolverVaultToken` tokens. Additionally, the `burnFrom()` function allows tokens to be burned from another account, provided that the account has been approved.

## Impact
Anyone with the necessary approval can use the burnFrom function to burn tokens from a foreign account. Similarly, everyone can use the burn function to burn their tokens.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement a `BURNER_ROLE` and enhance access control for the `burn` and `burnFrom` functions to effectively prevent unauthorized burning.

```diff
contract SolverVaultToken is ERC20, ERC20Burnable, AccessControlEnumerable {
    ...
    
+   function burn(uint256 value) public override onlyRole(BURNER_ROLE) {
+       ERC20Burnable.burn(value);
+   }

+   function burnFrom(address account, uint256 value) public override onlyRole(BURNER_ROLE) {
+       ERC20Burnable.burnFrom(account, value);
+   }
}
```
