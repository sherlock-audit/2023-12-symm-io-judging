# [M-1] `SolverVaults::requestWithdraw` function perform a division before multiplication when calculating `amountInCollateralDecimals` therefore resulting in precision loss when `solverVaultTokenDecimals` is more than `collateralDecimals`

## Summary
The `SolverVaults::requestWithdraw` function calculates `amountInCollateralDecimals` by dividing the amount by `10^(solverVaultTokenDecimals - collateralTokenDecimals)` when `solverVaultTokenDecimals` is greater than `collateralTokenDecimals`. This division before multiplication can result in precision loss, especially for amounts that are not multiples of the divisor. In Solidity, which uses integer arithmetic, division leads to truncation of the fractional part, causing the final converted amount to be less precise.

## Vulnerability Detail
Add the below test case to `test/SolverVault.test.ts`

<details>
<summary>PoC</summary>
</br>

```javascript
//existing unit tests under 'requestWithdraw' test suite

it("should demonstrate precision loss in amount conversion", async function () {
  const withdrawAmount2 = 150n;

  const rec = await receiver.getAddress();
  await expect(
    solverVault.connect(user).requestWithdraw(withdrawAmount2, rec)
  ).to.emit(solverVault, "WithdrawRequestEvent");

  const request = await solverVault.withdrawRequests(0);
  expect(request[2]).to.equal(RequestStatus.Pending);
  //supposed to be 1.5 but because of precision loss it is 1
  expect(request[1]).to.equal(1n);
});
```

</details>


## Impact
1. Precision Loss: Users may lose fractional amounts of their assets due to the truncation in division, particularly when converting between tokens of different decimal places.

2. User Dissatisfaction: Precision loss, even if fractional, can lead to user dissatisfaction, especially in scenarios where large amounts or frequent transactions are involved.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Proposed Changes in `SolverVaults` contract:

<details>
<summary>Code</summary>
</br>

```diff
function requestWithdraw(
    uint256 amount,
    address receiver
) external whenNotPaused {

    ...

+   uint256 precisionFactor = 10 ** 3; // Adjust precision factor as needed

    uint256 amountInCollateralDecimals;
    if (collateralTokenDecimals >= solverVaultTokenDecimals) {
        amountInCollateralDecimals = amount * (10 ** (collateralTokenDecimals - solverVaultTokenDecimals));
    } else {
-       amountInCollateralDecimals = amount / (10 ** (solverVaultTokenDecimals - collateralTokenDecimals));
+       uint256 adjustedAmount = amount * precisionFactor;
+       amountInCollateralDecimals = (adjustedAmount / (10 ** (solverVaultTokenDecimals - collateralTokenDecimals))) / precisionFactor;
    }

    ...
}
```

</details>

1. The modified logic uses an if-else structure for clarity and better control flow.

2. In the else block (when solverVaultTokenDecimals > collateralTokenDecimals), it first multiplies the amount by the precisionFactor to introduce additional precision.

3. The division is then performed on this adjusted amount, followed by a division by the same precisionFactor to revert back to the original scale. This approach minimizes the precision loss due to integer division.

4. Precision Factor: The value of `precisionFactor` (in this case, 10 \*\* 3) needs to be chosen carefully. It should be high enough to mitigate precision loss but not so high as to risk overflow in the multiplication.
