# Contracts deployed in Arbitrum and Optimism will not work due to the new PUSH0 opcode.

## Summary
The Solidity version 0.8.20 introduces the new **`PUSH0`** opcode, which is incompatible with the Arbitrum and Optimism chains.
## Vulnerability Detail
As indicated in the contest details, the deployed contracts will be on the following chains: 
**`BNB, Arbitrum, Polygon, Base, opBNB, zkEVM, Optimism`**

The contracts are using the version ^0.8.20 of the compiler.

Solidity version 0.8.20 and higher are incompatible with the Arbitrum and Optimism chains due to the introduction of the new **`PUSH0`** opcode.

- Optimism resource: https://docs.optimism.io/chain/differences

## Impact
Contracts deployed on Arbitrum and Optimism chains may not function as intended or not work.

## Tool used
Manual Review.
## Recommendation
Change the compiler version to 0.8.19 or lower.
