# Contract does not work with USDT because of incorrect function signature

## Summary
Solver Vault contract uses a normal IERC20 interface and a normal approve() function call. Since `approve()` function of USDT doesn't return a boolean as expected by the interface, this would leave the contract unusable.

## Vulnerability Detail
If collateral token is USDT, the contract's main functions won't work as intended since the `depositToSymmio` function will fail.

        require(
            IERC20(collateralTokenAddress).approve(address(symmio), amount),   // <-----
            "SolverVault: Approve failed"
        );

[USDT](https://etherscan.io/token/0xdac17f958d2ee523a2206206994597c13d831ec7#code) approve signature: function approve(address spender, uint value) public;

[OpenZeppelin ERC20](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC20/IERC20.sol) approve signature: function approve(address spender, uint256 value) external returns (bool);

## Impact
Contract will not able to work with USDT like in Q&A:

    Which ERC20 tokens do you expect will interact with the smart contracts?

    USDT, USDC

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add support for USDT by importing another interface with `approve()` function that don't return values.
