# Approval and Transfer Race Condition

## Summary
Approval and Transfer Race Condition

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-symm-io/blob/main/solver-vaults/contracts/SolverVaults.sol#L183

## Vulnerability Detail
The "Approval and Transfer Race Condition" refers to a situation where two operations, approval, and transfer, are performed separately without being atomic, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities. In the context of ERC-20 tokens, this often involves the approve function, followed by the transferFrom or transfer function.

Here's a breakdown of the race condition:

Approval Operation: The line `require(IERC20(collateralTokenAddress).approve(address(symmio), depositAmount), "SolverVault: Approve failed");` is performing an approval operation. It allows the `symmio` contract to spend `depositAmount` tokens on behalf of the `SolverVault` contract.

External Call: Following the approval, an external call to `symmio.depositFor` is made. This external call can potentially be influenced by other transactions or attackers if there is a delay between the approval and the external call.

If another transaction intervenes and changes the approval status after the approval but before the external call, it could lead to unexpected behavior. For example, an attacker might exploit this race condition to manipulate the approved amount or redirect the approved amount to a different address.

## Code Snippet

    function depositToSymmio(
        uint256 amount
    ) external onlyRole(DEPOSITOR_ROLE) whenNotPaused {
        uint256 contractBalance = IERC20(collateralTokenAddress).balanceOf(
            address(this)
        );
        require(
            contractBalance - lockedBalance >= amount,
            "SolverVault: Insufficient contract balance"
        );
        require(
            IERC20(collateralTokenAddress).approve(address(symmio), amount),
            "SolverVault: Approve failed"
        );
        symmio.depositFor(solver, amount);
        emit DepositToSymmio(msg.sender, solver, amount);
    }

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

To mitigate this race condition, it's a common practice to combine the approval and transfer into a single, atomic operation. In the case of ERC-20 tokens, the `transferFrom` function can be used in place of separate `approve` and `transfer` functions. This ensures that the approval and transfer happen in a single, uninterruptible step, reducing the risk of race conditions.

## Code Snippet

        function depositToSymmio(uint256 amount) external onlyRole(DEPOSITOR_ROLE) whenNotPaused {
             uint256 contractBalance = IERC20(collateralTokenAddress).balanceOf(address(this));
               require(contractBalance - lockedBalance >= amount, "SolverVault: Insufficient contract balance");

             // Use a separate state variable to track the amount to be deposited
                uint256 depositAmount = amount;
            // Update the state
              currentDeposit -= amount;

          // Make atomic external call with transferFrom
            require(IERC20(collateralTokenAddress).transferFrom(msg.sender, address(symmio), depositAmount), "SolverVault: 
               TransferFrom failed");

              emit DepositToSymmio(msg.sender, solver, depositAmount);
        }
