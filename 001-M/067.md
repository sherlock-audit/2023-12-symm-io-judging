# Compiler Version Incompatibility with Layer 2 Networks: Deployment Issues on Arbitrum

## Summary
Compiler Version Incompatibility with Layer 2 Networks: Deployment Issues on Arbitrum
## Vulnerability Detail
Solc ^0.8.20 on Arbitrum won’t be able to deploy, as Arbitrum doesn’t support the PUSH0 opcode, as seen here: https://docs.arbitrum.io/for-devs/concepts/differences-between-arbitrum-ethereum/solidity-support.
## Impact
The contract cannot be deployed on Arbitrum (or other chains that doen't support PUSH0).

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The compiler version should be changed to 0.8.19 or the foundry.toml file should use the paris EVM version. Suggestion would be to use the latter solution, so the contract benefits from the integrated "unchecked loop increment" gas savings feature that was introduced in solc 0.8.22 (https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/releases/tag/v0.8.22).
