# Insecure Usage of approve Function in SolverVault

## Summary
The contract uses the standard approve function from the ERC20 token interface and this implementation can expose the contract to potential race condition vulnerabilities and compatibility issues with certain ERC20 tokens and it's should Update the contract to use safeApprove
## Vulnerability Detail
The approve function in ERC20 tokens allows a spender to withdraw a specified amount of tokens on behalf of the token owner. The standard implementation of approve does not address the vulnerability where a malicious actor could potentially exploit the time window between the approval and the execution of a new allowance and also not all ERC20 token implementations return a boolean success value as per the EIP-20 standard. 
This inconsistency can lead to unexpected behaviors when interacting with different ERC20 tokens
the vulnerable part : 
```solidity
  );
        require(
            IERC20(collateralTokenAddress).approve(address(symmio), amount),
            "SolverVault: Approve failed"
        
```
## Impact
-  If an attacker can predict the timing of an approve call, they might exploit the race condition to manipulate allowances.
- also interactions with non-standard ERC20 tokens that do not return a boolean value on approve could lead to failed transactions or unexpected contract states.

## Tool used
Manual Review
## Recommendation
- Replace the approve function with safeApprove from the SafeERC20 library to enhance security and ensure compatibility across different ERC20 token implementations. 
 as an example :
`IERC20(collateralTokenAddress).safeApprove(address(symmio), amount);`
