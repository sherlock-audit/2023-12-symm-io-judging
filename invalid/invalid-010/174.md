# Attack can spam small withdraws and make the balancer run a deficit

## Summary

Symm allows users to deposit collateralToken in exchange for solverVaultToken and then withdraw their collateralToken in exchange for their solverVaultToken. The issue arises since [there is nothing stopping the user from withdrawing a single wei every time see the link](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-symm-io/blob/main/solver-vaults/contracts/SolverVaults.sol#L201-L234) or check the code snippet.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the event that a user withdraws 1 wei 100_000 times the same as 1 USDC with 6 decimals split over 100_000 transactions when the balancer wants to fulfill these withdrawals, the balancer will have to take a take a direct loss on the gas fee. This is because the gap between `_paybackRatio` and the `amount`, which is calculated as `withdrawRequests[id].amount (1) * _paybackRatio 1e17 or 70%) / 1e18` in this senario, will be 0. 

This amount will not be sufficient to cover the gas cost of the transaction on any chain, and it could cause significant loss and halt withdrawals if left unchecked. An attacker could continually do this until the balancer is drained of funds, and no more withdrawals can be accepted until the balancer is topped up with more ether.

## Impact
an attacker can drain the funds of the balancer via gas griefing

## Code Snippet

```Solidity
    function requestWithdraw( 
        uint256 amount,
        address receiver
    ) external whenNotPaused {
        require(
            SolverVaultToken(solverVaultTokenAddress).balanceOf(msg.sender) >=
                amount,
            "SolverVault: Insufficient token balance"
        );

        SolverVaultToken(solverVaultTokenAddress).burnFrom(msg.sender, amount);

        uint256 amountInCollateralDecimals = collateralTokenDecimals >=
            solverVaultTokenDecimals
            ? amount * 
                (10 ** (collateralTokenDecimals - solverVaultTokenDecimals))
            : amount /
                (10 ** (solverVaultTokenDecimals - collateralTokenDecimals));

        currentDeposit -= amountInCollateralDecimals; 

        withdrawRequests.push(
            WithdrawRequest({
                receiver: receiver,
                amount: amountInCollateralDecimals,
                status: RequestStatus.Pending,
                acceptedRatio: 0
            })
        );
        emit WithdrawRequestEvent( 
            withdrawRequests.length - 1,
            receiver,
            amountInCollateralDecimals
        );
    }
```

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
add a minimum withdrawal amount or append a small gas fee and subtract it from the user's withdraw
