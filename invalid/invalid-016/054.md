## Impact
unexpected Withdraw for address owner that Requests a Withdraw

## Code Snippet
 ```javascript
 @>  function claimForWithdrawRequest(uint256 requestId) external whenNotPaused {
        require(
            requestId < withdrawRequests.length,
            "SolverVault: Invalid request ID"
        );
   @>       WithdrawRequest storage request = withdrawRequests[requestId];
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
1.have a state variable for mapping an address to a requestId that is set in the requestWithdraw function
2.claimForWithdrawRequest function should not take any parameter
3.msg.sender should be to get the  requestId and then pass it to the withdrawRequests array to get a storage element

```diff
-        function claimForWithdrawRequest(uint256 requestId) external whenNotPaused {
        require(
            requestId < withdrawRequests.length,
            "SolverVault: Invalid request ID"
        );
-       WithdrawRequest storage request = withdrawRequests[requestId];

        require(
            request.status == RequestStatus.Ready,
            "SolverVault: Request not ready for withdrawal"
        );

        request.status = RequestStatus.Done;
        uint256 amount = (request.amount * request.acceptedRatio) / 1e18;
        lockedBalance -= amount;
        IERC20(collateralTokenAddress).safeTransfer(request.receiver, amount);
        emit WithdrawClaimedEvent(requestId, request.receiver);
    }

+     mapping(address=>uint256) public AddressToWithdrawRequest;

+      function claimForWithdrawRequest() external whenNotPaused {
+       uint256 requestId = AddressToWithdrawRequest[msg.sender];
        require(
            requestId < withdrawRequests.length,
            "SolverVault: Invalid request ID"
        );
        WithdrawRequest storage request = withdrawRequests[requestId];

        require(
            request.status == RequestStatus.Ready,
            "SolverVault: Request not ready for withdrawal"
        );

        request.status = RequestStatus.Done;
        uint256 amount = (request.amount * request.acceptedRatio) / 1e18;
        lockedBalance -= amount;
        IERC20(collateralTokenAddress).safeTransfer(request.receiver, amount);
        emit WithdrawClaimedEvent(requestId, request.receiver);
    }
