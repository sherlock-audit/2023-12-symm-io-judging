# Risk of lost funds due to lack of zero-address check in requestWithdraw function

## Summary

Missing zero address check on`receiver` in `SolverVaults::requestWithdraw()` can lead to permanent lost of funds.

## Vulnerability Detail

`SolverVaults::requestWithdraw()` function is missing a check to ensure that the `receiver` argument does not equal the zero address. As aresult, `SolverVaults::claimForWithdrawRequest()` function could transfer funds to the zero address.

When they request a withdrawal, users return back their vault tokens which are burned. Added to the fact that there is no way of changing the receiver of a withdrawal request, the funds would be permanently lost.

## Impact

Funds might be permanently lost.
