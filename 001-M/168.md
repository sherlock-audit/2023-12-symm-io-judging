# [M] - PUSH0 Opcode not supported on every EVM Chains.

## Summary
Version 0.8.20 of Solidity uses the PUSH0 Opcode, which is not available on every chains that the project wants to deploy.

## Vulnerability Detail

The latest version of Solidity used the Opcode PUSH0 ([EIP-3855](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3855)).
Not all chains accept this Opcode, which will result in an EVM error at deployment from the chains where the contracts are deployed, excluding Mainnet.

## Impact 

Contract Deployment on Ethereum Mainnet is not affected by this issue.
Contracts will revert on Deployment on those chains: BNB, Arbitrum, Polygon, Base, opBNB, zkEVM, and Optimism.

## POC 

The OPCODE PUH0 has the hex code of "0x5f" : https://www.evm.codes/#5f?fork=shanghai
If we check the contract's bytecode, we can see that the bytecode contains many implementations of the 0x5f hexadecimal code.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

 - Use an old version of Solidity if you want to deploy the same contract on different EVM chains. 
   Version 0.8.19 is working just fine.
