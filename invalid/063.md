# The SolverVaultToken will inflate

## Summary

The `SolverVaultToken` will inflate 

## Vulnerability Detail

 When a user deposited into the  the `SolverVault`  contract , lets say  100 `USDC`  (100e6), some portion of `SolverVaultToken` is being minted along the way using this calculations :  
```solidity 
uint256 amountInSolverVaultTokenDecimals = solverVaultTokenDecimals >= collateralTokenDecimals
            ? amount * (10 ** (solverVaultTokenDecimals - collateralTokenDecimals))
            : amount / (10 ** (collateralTokenDecimals - solverVaultTokenDecimals));
```
since `solverVaultTokenDecimals ` (18)  is >  `collateralTokenDecimals` (6) the calculations will be  ` amount * (10 ** (solverVaultTokenDecimals - collateralTokenDecimals))` , so 100 USDC (100e6) will mint a user  `100000000000000000000`   because of this calculation 

```solidity
SolverVaultToken(solverVaultTokenAddress).mint(msg.sender, amountInSolverVaultTokenDecimals); // notice the amountInSolverVaultTokenDecimals
```

now when user decided to withdraw his  100 USDC (100e6), hes required to specify the `amount` and that amount was used to burn the previously minted tokens, like :
```solidity
SolverVaultToken(solverVaultTokenAddress).burnFrom(msg.sender, amount); // @audit should burn vaulttoken not amount
```

the issue here is , the user wanted to withdraw his previously deposited 100 USDC, and has specify it in the amount parameter , that means  `100e6` will be burned  leaving a woofing `99999999999900000000` `SolverVaultToken`  to the user.

This is what i got after running a test using foundry 

```solidity 
[PASS] testSetSYmnioAddress() (gas: 916774)
Logs:
  BalanceAfterMinting: 100000000000000000000
  BalanceAfterWithdrawRequestOrBurn: 99999999999900000000
```

## Impact

The `SolverVaultToken` will inflate  as whenever a user deposit and withdraw, the corresponding minted token is not whats getting burn

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

1. Should  `amountInCollateralDecimals` be implemented  correctly , it should be used for the calculations of amount to burn
2. Or a new computation that will ensure the amount is getting burn not the requested amount amount because they are of different decimals `(18, 6)`  The computation will look something like : 

```solidity
   amountToBurn =  amount / (10 ** (solverVaultTokenDecimals - collateralTokenDecimals));
// Note : This is an example , the devs should think of a better way to implement it making difference between the requested amount(USDC) and the burn amount(solverVaultToken)
```
