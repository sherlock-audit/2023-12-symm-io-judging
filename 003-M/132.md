# Incorrect approval in `depositToSymmio` function

## Summary

`SolverVaults.sol` interacts with USDT and USDC and uses the approve function for token allowances. However, it does not account for the need to reset allowances to zero before setting a new value, potentially leading to race conditions.

## Vulnerability Detail

The contract sets a new allowance with the approve function directly. For tokens like USDT and USDC, direct overwriting of non-zero allowances can cause transactions to fail or expose the system to race conditions. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by watching the blockchain for `approve` calls and use the approved tokens between the old and new approvals.

## Impact

Potential unauthorized token transfers and financial loss.

## Code Snippet

[SolverVaults.sol](https://github.dev/sherlock-audit/2023-12-symm-io/blob/main/solver-vaults/contracts/SolverVaults.sol#L193-L196)

```solidity
require(
    IERC20(collateralTokenAddress).approve(address(symmio), amount),
    "SolverVault: Approve failed"
);
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

First, reset any non-zero allowance to zero and then set the new allowance.
```diff
+  // Reset the allowance to 0
+  require(IERC20(collateralTokenAddress).approve(address(symmio), 0), "Reset failed");

   // Set the new allowance
   require(IERC20(collateralTokenAddress).approve(address(symmio), amount), "Approve failed");
```
