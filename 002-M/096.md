# USDT approval will revert

## Summary

Checking the return value when approving USDT tokens results in a runtime error making it impossible to deposit to Symmio.

## Vulnerability Detail

When depositing to symmio, the tokens are approved first:
```solidity
        require(
            IERC20(collateralTokenAddress).approve(address(symmio), amount),
            "SolverVault: Approve failed"
        );
        symmio.depositFor(solver, amount);
```

However, this approach does not work with a token in scope. USDT approval function doesnâ€™t comply with the ERC20 standard, it does not return true on success: https://etherscan.io/token/0xdac17f958d2ee523a2206206994597c13d831ec7#code L199

## Impact

Not possible to deposit USDT.
