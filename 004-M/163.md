# `WithdrawRequest.amount` Precision Loss

## Summary
 Precision loss when calculating `WithdrawRequest.amount` leading to `loss of Equity`.
 
## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
function requestWithdraw(
        uint256 amount,
        address receiver
    ) external whenNotPaused {
        require(
            SolverVaultToken(solverVaultTokenAddress).balanceOf(msg.sender) >=
                amount,
            "SolverVault: Insufficient token balance"
        );
        SolverVaultToken(solverVaultTokenAddress).burnFrom(msg.sender, amount);

        uint256 amountInCollateralDecimals = collateralTokenDecimals >=
            solverVaultTokenDecimals
            ? amount *
                (10 ** (collateralTokenDecimals - solverVaultTokenDecimals))
            : amount /
                (10 ** (solverVaultTokenDecimals - collateralTokenDecimals)); // <- 

        currentDeposit -= amountInCollateralDecimals;

        withdrawRequests.push(
            WithdrawRequest({
                receiver: receiver,
                amount: amountInCollateralDecimals,
                status: RequestStatus.Pending,
                acceptedRatio: 0
            })
        );
        emit WithdrawRequestEvent(
            withdrawRequests.length - 1,
            receiver,
            amountInCollateralDecimals
        );
    }
```
When `amountInCollateralDecimals` is calculated where `collateralTokenDecimals  < solverVaultTokenDecimals`, the `WithdrawRequest.amount`  received by a user may be `less than what they requested to withdraw`, while still `burning the
 user's vault tokens`. This is cause the `EVM` lacks `floating-point arithmetics`, thus when it executes `integer division`, `the division result truncates any remainder`, leading to `precision loss`.

## Impact
`Precision loss` when calculating `WithdrawRequest.amount` can lead to `loss of equity by user` which may seem negligible in a 
single transaction but `accumulate rapidly in a high-frequency trading environment` resulting in `significant losses` and potentially `impacting the protocol's reputation`.

Eg. Given :
- `solverVaultTokenDecimals == 8`
- `collateralTokenDecimals  == 6`

A `requestWithdraw`  would have a potential `precision loss` of `10 ** (solverVaultTokenDecimals - collateralTokenDecimals)` in this case `10**2` {10**(8-6)}.

_POC : Add under `requestWithdraw`_
```javascript
it("Precision loss", async function () {
            // Withdraw Amount
            const withdraw_amount = 299
            // amount after precision loss of 10 ** (solverVaultTokenDecimals - collateralTokenDecimals)
            const amount_after_precision_loss = 2

            // Request withdraw
            await expect(solverVault.connect(user).requestWithdraw(withdraw_amount, await receiver.getAddress()))
                .to.emit(solverVault, "WithdrawRequestEvent")
                .withArgs(0, receiver.getAddress(), amount_after_precision_loss)
            
            const request = await solverVault.withdrawRequests(0)
            
            // Due to precision loss request.amount is 2 
            // Equity loss of 0.99
            expect(request[1]).to.equal(2)
            expect(request[2]).to.equal(RequestStatus.Pending)
        })
```
