## Vulnerability Detail
[L295](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-symm-io/blob/main/solver-vaults/contracts/SolverVaults.sol#L295)


When `acceptedRatio ` is less than that may occur precision loss due to a higher denominator,  if you have a small numerator and a large denominator, the result of the division may get rounded, leading to a loss of precision. This is a common issue in numerical computing, and it's important to be aware of it, especially in scientific and engineering applications where accuracy is crucial.

## Impact
function `claimForWithdrawRequest()` initialized `uint256 amount = (request.amount * request.acceptedRatio) / 1e18;`  
here due to the precision loss amount is always 0, hence

`lockedBalance` is not updated cause the user withdraws unlimited funds. 


## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
 make sure that ` request.acceptedRatio` is always 1e18 or more
