## Summary

SolverVault contract with one potential vulnerability found.

## Vulnerability Detail 

Improper Access Control Severity: High
The contract relies on access control roles to restrict sensitive functions like deposits, withdrawals, pausing etc. However, the deployer is granted all roles by default which could allow them full control over the contract.

## Impact

The deployer would be able to abuse their powerful permissions like extracting funds, pausing the contract, modifying parameters without restrictions.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

The deployer role should be separate from the other roles. Roles should be assigned to designated addresses instead of the deployer by default for proper separation of privileges.
