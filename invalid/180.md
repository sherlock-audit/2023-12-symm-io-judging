# Insufficient provided amount may use deposits to cover for accepted withdrawals

## Summary

Withdrawals will be executed using tokens from deposits if the provided amount while accepting those is insufficient.

## Vulnerability Detail

The implementation of `acceptWithdrawRequest()` takes a `providedAmount` argument that can be used to transfer collateral tokens into the contract to cover for the accepted withdrawals.

The amount of tokens needed to execute the withdrawals are added to the already pending `lockedBalance` and then checked against the current collateral token balance of the contract to see if that is enough to cover for all accepted withdrawals. However, there is no link between the provided amount and the newly accepted withdrawals. Failure to provide enough tokens will consume money from deposits when withdrawals are executed.

## Impact

Withdrawals may be executed using tokens from fresh deposits.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Ensure that provided amount covers for the new accepted withdrawals (each amount multiplied by the payback ratio).
